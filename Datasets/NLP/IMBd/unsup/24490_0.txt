If you liked Buckaroo Bonsai, then you'll enjoy Remo. A tough cop gets beaten close to death, and is secreted away to a secret government training facility. With a martial arts master (Roddy McDowell as an ancient Korean) as fighting and spiritual adviser, Remo Williams becomes an almost mystical, although reluctant,secret agent/warrior. The humor mirrors how 'Buckaroo' was done, with as much action and satire as you can handle. Is is important to note that in watching this film, you will also learn the secret technique of bringing a woman to ecstasy in seconds!!!! Joel Grey is fantastic in a roll you would never picture him in. Comical at times, he also makes you believe that he COULD kill you with two fingers. This movie alone made me an instant Fred Ward fan. A martial arts movie, a spy movie, a high comedy, a low comedy, a satire, an action movie...you decide, but I bet money that this becomes one of your favorites!
