Overall, it is a very good movie although some of the Chinese to English translation was not well done. The movie does comply with a plot climax and exposing the corruption idea of a supreme power at court in a communist society. Although there might be some scenes are not matching the real scene, however, it is understandable of how a movie is made to present a story into a reality. My overall experience with this movie is great. There are many beautiful scene in China having been brought in the movie as well as how the political and local culture at the old days of China. It is a tear earning movie as well as a temporary aggravation of the mistreatment to foreigner in China at that time. This makes me think of 2008 Olympics in China, what will it be like.
