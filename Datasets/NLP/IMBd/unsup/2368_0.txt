I had read all of the bad reviews of this film, so I didn't know what to expect. To be truthful, I thought the movie was a great addition to the Phantasm series. For all those who hate the ending being so weird and it just leaving you hanging, well think about this: ALL OF THE PHANTASM MOVIES END THAT WAY!!!!! All of the films leave you wondering "what happened next?!?!?!" I thought oblIVion was cool and just as good as the other sequels...
