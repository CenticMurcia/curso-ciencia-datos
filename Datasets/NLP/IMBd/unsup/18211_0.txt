I am a big fan of retro movies. So when I started watching this, knowing that Brando is playing and that its an espionage movie including WW2 elements I was pretty excited. Unfortunately it was a big waste of time. The plot is so complex that you simply cannot follow it. Many names in the script and subplots under the main plot and at the end...you really wonder what the **** happened! I mean there's a key issue in the movie, synthetic oil, but besides that, you really can't figure out who's working for who and what's going on! Scott is a great actor and I also liked Brando's performance (he plays for 10 minutes or so in this 2-hours movie) but that's simply not enough. The main problem with this movie is the script and the way the director used it. You simply do not have the time to figure out what is going on in each scene. There's a scene at the end where almost all the names are referenced but instead of making things clear, hell broke loose! If you like a good movie, choose something else.
