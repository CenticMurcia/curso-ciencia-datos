this is the kind of pussy film that women love. all the females are good, and all the men are evil. no exceptions here. except for kids, of course, who are always virtuous in these American family films.<br /><br />the most important virtue is fidelity. this gets beaten into a pulp.<br /><br />what about some sophistication? think of french films where adultery is the norm. and Mormons with their multiple wives. when will America grow up?<br /><br />and of course as in all American films, in the end the loser-guy reforms, comes around, and conforms to the female ethos. it's a wonder the poor slob, and a doctor to boot!, isn't impotent after going through all the shame, the shame, the shame.<br /><br />a good antidote to this weepy feely goody film might be Casanova, but i haven't seen it yet!
