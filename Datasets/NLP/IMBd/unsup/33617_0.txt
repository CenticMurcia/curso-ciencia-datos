Go back to the beginning and the Lutzes.could we have imagined back then what their hoax was going to do to the world .even to this day people keep trying to go to the house which has been remodeled and the address changed,hollywood still keeps churning out these stupid fictitous movies regarding the orginal hoax ..the owners who moved in after the lutzes never had any incidents and even sued hollywood and the lutzes for fabricating the whole thing. Makes me wanna go back in time and kidnap ronald defeo to avoid the whole thing. Crappy movie after crappy movie all because one family couldnt pay their bills so they had to concoct the most infamous paranormal hoax ever.
