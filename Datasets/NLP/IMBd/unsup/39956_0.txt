Folks I live 10 miles from Shannon airport and I can tell you this - it is not located in Galway Bay and does not have a seaside beach. This show puts it about 50 miles from where it actually is. A small bit of research, say looking at a map, would've cleared this up. Dublin is not in north county Louth by the way and Queens University is not in Dublin, it is in Belfast. The very notion of an Irish university named after a British royal is insulting. The building used in the closeup shot is Dublin Castle. I like the new spin on America saving the world by the way. America takes one for the team i.e the rest of the world. An awful pile of rubbish this was.
