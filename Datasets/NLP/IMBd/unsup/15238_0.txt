Maybe just the best TV series ever........although it was so short lived. I've read the articles and this show had so much competition including a few times it was canceled because of Superbowls and other such stupid reasons (I'd rather watch this show than the superbowl any day)<br /><br />IT's sad too because the show had character depth and was good... really good...well thought out , great plot great writing. great everything.<br /><br />God, it seems only the trash ends up making it long term on tv and all the good quality shows die young.<br /><br />Sad :(<br /><br />BB
