I have heard that this movie came before the Blair Witch Project, which I thought was excellent (and in my opinion it's popularity is well deserved), and that it may have inspired the Blair Witch Project. Like the Blair Witch Project, the Last Broadcast is marketed as a horror movie. Although I wasn't expecting "another" Blair Witch Project, I was expecting a horror movie in the same low budget style as the Blair Witch Project. That's, after all, how this movie is marketed, a low budget horror movie. Well, it's certainly low budget, but it's definitely no horror.<br /><br />Everything this movie tries to do fails. If there is a C (or even D) category for movies, this is it. Dead End and the Blair Witch Project are two low budget movies which prove that low budget movies can be A movies, for sure. The Last Broadcast is unprofessional and only succeeds in misleading the viewer. It's hard to be specific without giving away any spoilers, and that's exactly what this movie requires to be exposed. Whatever you expect to see, you won't. However this movie is marketed, whatever the DVD box tells you on the backside, just know that it's misleading and unless you don't have any expectations, you will be disappointed.<br /><br />There is nothing else worth to say about this movie. Imagine renting the Terminator and instead of seeing some science fiction action, you get to see a lower than a straight-to-DVD quality movie about something that is supposed to resemble the Terminator. That's the Last Broadcast. A complete waste of time.<br /><br />The tagline of this movie is "what actually happened that night in the woods?" My answer is "nothing interesting".
