This is the most idiotic horror i've seen lately. Actors are absolute talentless teens and the big drug dealer seems to be at his very first movie, without any reversals. Please, movie makers, spare us these embarrassing productions. I do not recommend this, except to psychopathic little children =)). Extremely low budget, almost no plot (the entrance of Darrel is forced somehow, ... he was hitch hiking and suddenly he is in the middle of the action...). Well, the music was the only good thing about it. Oh, and what's with the "renoir" golden light on everything. To me - at least - golden doesn't inspire terror, but a heavenly atmosphere ... what were they thinking ? Seen session 9 ? GREEN IS THE COLOUR PPL !
