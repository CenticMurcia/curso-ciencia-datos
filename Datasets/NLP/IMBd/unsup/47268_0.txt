I was very disappointed in the story line of this film. The cast did an admirable job with an over-blown, far-fetched plot. Also, there are many discrepancies in the relationships between the characters. Obviously the writer and director were trying to confuse the audience by hiding the "true" identities of some of the characters. There is nothing wrong with that in this type of movie. However, doing so by having characters say and do things that openly contradict earlier scenes is not excusable. The performances of Connery, Zeta-Jones, and Rhames are very good considering what they had to work with as far as dialogue goes. As a gen-x male, I must applaud the appearance of Catherine Zeta-Jones. WOW!!!! It almost made everything else seem unimportant.
