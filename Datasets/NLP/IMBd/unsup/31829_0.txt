I watched Pardes about 3 days ago. It was midnight and I had no wish to see a movie which was three hours long. I was going to only see about the first 30 minutes of it but this movie was so good that I watched it all the way through. <br /><br />Many reviewers have said that this film is 'Anti-American' propaganda and 'stereotypes' NRIs. As an NRI myself, I must greatly DISAGREE with conclusions like these. This movie is nothing short of a masterpiece.<br /><br />The exaggerations of Indian morals and of western vices are done for a reason, and a very good reason at that. The director shows the audience the best of India and the worst of America to make the viewer appreciate the Indian culture our parents try to impart to us. Granted, there are some lines that the American 'bad son' (Rajiv) says which are ridiculous and comical, such as:<br /><br />---------------------------------------------------------------- Paul: We are going to India? To fight? Rajiv: Yes. Paul: But that is not right. Rajiv: Why? Paul: We are not bad people Rajiv, we are good Indians. Rajiv: (While shaking his head) But I am bad, Paul! -----------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />In all candor, I don't know of any Americans who speak like this (or of any other human beings for that matter). The movie has hyperbole like this throughout it. However, let us put all the cards on the table at this point.....<br /><br />I know for a fact that many NRIs look upon their homeland with disdain. They won't even visit it, much less want to stay there. But guess what? This movie isn't aimed at that audience. It is aimed at Indians who have not forgotten that without the culture imparted by their motherland, they would never be as successful, nor have the extended families we take for granted. Basically, if you're an ABCD or an NRI who has lived in America for 10+ years, you won't enjoy this movie, probably because many immigrants adopt the ways of the denizens (just human nature to do so I suppose).<br /><br />Lastly: I'm going to be starting medical school next year and I'll definitely be taking this movie with me. If I should forget who I am......what I am.....I know that I can watch this film and remember. A Hindustani.
