This really could have been written by committee. The plot is ridiculous and contrived, the script is painfully predictable, the characters are two-dimensional cardboard cut-outs, and the film's pay-off is painfully obvious from the beginning. I guess I didn't expect too much more from Schwimmer (I'm sure he'll get better with experience), but Pegg really should know better. <br /><br />This is a pretty feeble effort by all concerned, which, at times, is so cloyingly smothered in saccharine that you almost expect an irate Richard Curtis to appear, demanding royalties and screaming about breach of copyright. <br /><br />3/10
