Trashing "Perfect" is an act of unnecessary cruelty. A film where every character attaches serious importance to Rolling Stone articles calls for a depth of insight and cinematic brilliance even Welles would have trouble summoning. One wonders what projects Godfather cinematographer Gordon Willis gave up to lend his expertise to this embarrassment. Perhaps this film has value in warning future generations against the emptiness of Trendy Living.<br /><br />If any costume screen tests, outtakes, and deleted scenes featuring Jamie Lee Curtis exist, they could salvage the film for DVD. At 26, the enchanting Ms. Curtis delivered a powerful performance. Her dazzling beauty and inner power are the only facets of this creepy time-capsule that hold up today.
