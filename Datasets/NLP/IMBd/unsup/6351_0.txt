I didn't seem to think of this as being the unintentional laugh riot that many others acclaim it to be. Despite a few humorous and borderline surreal moments, it was very slow moving and actually depressing. I've never been a massive fan of Al Adamson's films, as in addition to being mean-spirited, they're kind of generic. Plus, he always filled them up with once great stars who were obviously way past their prime. Both J. Carrol Naish and Lon Chaney Jr look like absolute wrecks in this one. If you remember them in the 40s and than watch this, you'll probably become extremely depressed. In addition to those stars, Adamson manages to pick the most wooden and untalented actors for other roles. Sure, some of the fun of watching bad movies derives from the horrible acting, but eventually the lack of any remote skill becomes tiresome instead of amusing. Its pretty obvious that Regina Carrol was cast only because she was Mrs. Adamson, and Zandor Vorkov may well be the most uninspired Dracula ever on screen. Even the final monster mash is a bit of a let-down, as its too dark to really see whats happening on screen.<br /><br />As you can see, I am not a fan of this film or Adamson's works in general. Unlike Ed Wood, Phil Tucker, or H.G. Lewis, his bad films aren't usually "good" bad films. They'll have their moments for sure but overall will be very inconsistent. The only film by him I can legitimately say I enjoyed was "Satan's Sadists". Not to be confused with Paul Naschy's even worse "Dracula Vs. Frankenstein" from 1969 or a later Jess Franco film. (2/10)
