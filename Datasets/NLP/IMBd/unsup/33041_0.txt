This is not just a movie, It's actually 4 movies and a television series to boot! There are plotlines, similar characters, special effects, costumes and even dialog from "The Last Starfighter", "The Matrix", "Runaway", "Robocop" and "Star Trek". Even then they couldn't patch together a watchable film. Jamie Leigh Curtis gives a performance worthy of one those screams from Holloween and there ought to be a law limiting the number of Baldwin brothers allowed to torture us with awful performances. What reason did a great character actor like Donald Sutherland have to make a clunker like this, only god knows. One thing for certain, The next time I see this film it will probably be on "Mystery Science Theater 3000" getting about the same review...
