Legacy starts as Omega Kappa sorority house President Lana Stephens (Haylie Duff) is told by a rich & influential former house member & President (Jane Sibbett) that she wants her geeky daughter Katie (Kate Albrecht) to become one & to be treated well, Lana is disturbed by the idea of the less than perfect Katie joining her sorority & instead wants her friend Emily (Laura Ashlee Innes) to take the place so arranges Katie to be given a hard time at a party. During the party Lana finds Katie dead & when the body is found the police accuse her & two other Omega Kappa girls of the murder, to clear themselves the girls have to turn detective to unmask the real killer & save Omega Kappa's reputation & them from going to prison...<br /><br />Also known under the better sounding title of Pretty Little Devils this was directed by Irving Rothberg I wasn't sure what to expect from this going into it but even then I thought this was pretty poor stuff that feels like a thrown together mix of several genres none of which are done justice here. For the first half of Legacy it feels like some teen comedy like American Pie (1999) with college kids getting up to various risqué things like one guy filming him & his girl having sex & showing to his friends or a girl jacking a guy off & then rubbing the cum on her fingers over a fat geeky girls lips all set in the usual clichéd sorority & frat house with the usual clichéd character's like the air-headed bimbo, the geeks they pick on & the jock style lads who think about nothing but sex & beer. Sound familiar? Afetr about fifty odd dull unfunny minutes of this annoying nonsense Legacy switches genres & becomes a murder mystery but don't expect a Scream (1996) as this is pretty lame stuff with a really irritating three way interrogation with two cops as the film cuts between one of three girls to awful bouncy music as the relive the events we have mostly already seen & know. Then there's the expected twist ending which isn't much of a twist as some random character is revealed to be the killer & then it ends. At 90 odd minutes it feels long & the dreadful mixture of unfunny teen comedy & predictable murder mystery that is sub Scooby-Doo cartoon standard means I would recommend anyone thinking of watching this not to.<br /><br />There's some tame sexual scenes that feature no nudity, the girls aren't particularly good looking & there's zero gore. There's a bizarre scene featuring a highly strung police captain played by comedian Tom Green & the whole subplot about the two cops is totally forgotten about & they disappear before the film finishes. The whole film has a very cutesy pink look & I found it got on my nerves. There's also scenes of some girls kissing each other & two girls in skimpy swimwear about to wrestle each other in jelly but they never do. Pity.<br /><br />Apparently shot in Los Angeles & New York this went straight to video & whose only real claim to fame is that it stars Haylie Duff, enough said really.<br /><br />Legacy is an odd mix of teen comedy & murder mystery that just didn't do anything for me as it fails to deliver on either count as it doesn't quite know what it wants to be & to make matters even worse it's irritating. Definitely not recommended.
