This ranks among my most favorite of "Ernest" movies. The bumbling janitor Ernest P. Worrel (Jim Varney)and his wishy-washy, history-professor friend, Abner Melon (Ron James), stumble upon an old revolutionary-war cannon known as "Goliath," that Abner has been searching for his whole life. Unbeknownst to them, other people are also interested in the cannon because it contains the crown jewels of England: a history professor and Abner's boss, who moonlights as a crime boss, and an British secret agent who wants to recover the jewels for England.<br /><br />As the other reviewer stated, "Ernest Rides Again" is a bit more serious in plot, but it is filled with laughs nevertheless, especially in the scenes where Varney plays against straight-man Ron James. Don't miss the hilarious canon "chase" scenes! The relative seriousness of the plot makes the laughs that much funnier. Definitely a "must see," especially for those who have never seen an "Ernest" movie!
