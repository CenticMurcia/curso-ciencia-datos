This American Psycho 2 movie gets its audience of its name, which is one of the appealing ones int he field today. The name is just a lame attempt to cover up a bad movie, which worked for me, because i rented it. Having not seen the first American Psycho, i thought this would be as good as the Psycho-series was said to be, but this was just a lousy sequel for a lousy series. AP2 is a generic teen-slasher without the intensity of any kind. Murders are done without a feeling, and are often cencored using different camera angles. <br /><br />The acting itself isn't bad, but the characters are left shallow and predictable. The main character's actress was simply not beliavable in her role of a psycho.Who can honestly believe that some 18 -year old college girl could be a cold-blooded murderer? <br /><br />In fact the whole idea of having a cute Mila as the psycho is not from this planet. It just don't work! She's from the 70's show for crying out loud! the folks who wrote the story have lost their sense of reality and it shows.<br /><br />In Carrie 2 the character was much more believable, but then again this movie plays in the same league of bad movies. At least Carrie 2 looked professional...<br /><br />The motive for killings are unclear, and if there was any black-humour in this movie, i didn't catch it. More importantly it felt like the murders didn't take place at all, because the murder scenes didn't have any intensity or feelings involved. Every murder was such a clich√©, and very predictable, just like the dialogue, the places and the plot.<br /><br />The music was poor, it didn't create suitable atmosphere for the movie in overall. There was something very American in this movie: it was stupid. In some part there is some really patriotic song playing, something in "God bless America" - style. If that was the part when you were supposed to laugh or cry, i'd not know which one to do! I'd do both, I laugh and then I cry. It's just too stupid! Don't let your intelligence get hurt.<br /><br />I don't know why i tend to pick up the bad movies, this simply put me off watching movies for the whole month! I'm saying my money! I'm a damn student!
