Some worthless trivia to bestow. This is the very first movie ever to be shown on Mystery Science Theater 3000. Boy when you watch it you can see why. This movie screams to be made fun of. I know other people have made list reviews. Well, here's another one. It's more or less general thoughts on the movie.<br /><br />-very wooden acting. Robert Horton and Richard Jackel seem to be having a contest going on about who's the stiffer actor. The guys in the monsters suits are more lively than these guys.<br /><br />-Oh the monsters. I like these guys. They look like something that was designed by eight year olds. Assuming that was the target audience. For rubber Japanese monsters I thought they were fairly cool. Of course I'm a sucker for goofy aliens. They move awfully slow to be scary though.<br /><br />-All the sets look like cardboard. Who knows, maybe they are.<br /><br />-All the models seem as if they were made out of clearance sale craft supplies. The wires they were on even look cheap.<br /><br />-the title song ROCKS! I've had it stuck in my head for the past few days. Imagine the looks I get in Wal-Mart buying milk singing "The green sliiiiimmmmmme. The green slliiiimmmeeeee." I need to find a copy of that song. It's better than the whole movie.<br /><br />Funny, goofy B movie. Yet another I recommend for a 'bad movie night.'<br /><br />
