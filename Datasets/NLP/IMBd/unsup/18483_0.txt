Watching this is a celebration of how Jane Austen should be interpreted.<br /><br />This version is true to the novel and true to the characters and the wonderful tension between Elizabeth and Darcy is beautifully depicted.<br /><br />Not for a moment do you think that these two are not meant to be together.<br /><br />The Austen wit of both the main characters and the minor roles are strongly projected and the costumes and sets are faithful to the era of Austen's writing.<br /><br />There is an incredible scene where Elizabeth is playing the piano and her eyes meet and hold on Darcy's who is at the other end of the room. Now, for me, that is one of the most sexy and sensual scenes I have ever seen. Everything is flawless about this production.<br /><br />Superlative, satisfying and stunning.<br /><br />Do not miss it. 10 out of 10.
