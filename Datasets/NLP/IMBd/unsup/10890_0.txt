this is one of my all time favourites, it's up there with coogan, and, vic and bob<br /><br />the comedy is so good. some of it is complex, some of it is more obvious, but every single thing in this programme, was thought out, and is comedy gold.<br /><br />a lot of people don't like it, but really you need to have the right sense of humour, and understanding.<br /><br />the characters are funny, the horror spoofs are funny, even the way it looks makes me laugh. it's just great.<br /><br />the fact that there are only 6 episodes is a very sad thing.<br /><br />i would love to see more, but i think they will leave it as a series that will go down in history to all the people with a great sense of humour, as prolonging the programme may ruin something legendary. however, i still think they should continue in some way, perhaps a new theme. "garth marenghi's .....". still with the same type of humour, still made the same way with the same people, put with a different setting, and characters.<br /><br />anyway this "garth marenghi's darkplace" is one of the greatest comedies ever, and i will never forget it.
