The two leading characters in this film played by Gosling and Hopkins really grasped my interest. They were both engaging in a way that made me hang on to every word they said. Their war of wits with each other was a pleasure to watch. Gosling is refreshing and held his own against the brilliant Hopkins.<br /><br />With that said, the plot is quite a stretch. Hopkins kills his wife with a well-thought out, yet highly unlikely plot, which is only believable because Hopkins' character is so intelligent. But, at the same time, the plot is so unbelievable because Everything and I mean everything goes just as he has planned it. In the real world, in the heat of a murder, you would have to believe something would happen NOT according to plan. Something! Anyway, Hopkins faces Gosling in a war of wits in the courtroom. Gosling is a hotshot prosecuter who has never lost a case. Hopkins is simply a genius.<br /><br />However, and do not read this part if you don't want to spoil the ending, Gosling baits Hopkins at the end. Hopkins was acquitted with attempted murder and for some reason, the genius he is, doesn't realize that once his wife is now dead from her coma, he can be charged with murder. So, double indemnity is off the table. Sure he would have realized this...this guy who set up this unbelievable complex crime and then acted as his own lawyer and got an acquittal. Hmm.<br /><br />Anyway, I am rating this movie a 7 of 10 because it was entertaining to see Hopkins act as the super smart bad guy again and to have Gosling match wits with him just as well as Jody Foster did. If you think about this film and its plot holes and cheesiness of the copying of Hopkins' previous roles, then you lose respect for it. This will inadvertently happen to you if you ponder this movie AFTER watching it. With that said, in the throes of watching this film, you can be taken in. It can be entertaining. Not a great film. Mildly good. Rating 7 of 10 stars.
