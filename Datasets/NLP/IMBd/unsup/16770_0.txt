Myrna Loy vs. Jean Harlow, and when the man in question is Clark Gable in his prime, I'd fight over him too. A typical situation comedy with the usual misunderstandings, plot contrivances, and double entendres, is made delightful from the magnificent cast from top to bottom. Fast-paced and frantic, this is one to lie back, prop your feet up, and enjoy.
