Today I thought I'd give it a whirl and watch a sequel to a funny but quite thrilling and scary at times. I thought this would follow in the original's footsteps but I was wrong!<br /><br />The first thing I noticed was the painfully bad, stiff and empty acting from EVERY single soul in this movie! They wander around a set that looks like somebody's back garden and scream all over the place and chant irrelevant and childish comments that don't add to the plot or character. The acting itself is so hammy, it almost resembles a 1950's toothpaste advert! <br /><br />The second but the most important thing which made me laugh but in two halves was the effects: its the 21st century and it made me feel sick to watch a computer generated crocodile super-imposed onto the screen so badly when movies in the 30's had better effects than this trash!<br /><br />Overall I did have some laughs with this film but for all the wrong reasons: 1) Acting is beyond terrible and sets another all time low for future crap movies 2)Special effects are not special at all and they look like they were designed and filmed by a bunch of college students with a Â£200 budget. 3)It irritates me that in this day and age, people still make this drivel and why would they bother if they know they're not going to do a worthy job of it.
