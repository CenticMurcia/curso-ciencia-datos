Altogether the premise of this movie doesn't seem all that exciting, now that I really think about it there is not much to this movie but both myself and my sister have an odd obsession with it.<br /><br />It's funny, granted Jason Lee is always funny but the cast puts out some great performances. Not many people have seen this and the reactions to it are mixed. There are some parts with really great narrative and the story moves along quite fluidly. The characters are over the top and make for a very fun movie (Max, Natasha etc.).<br /><br />By no means one of the great films or anything, but definitely one of my favs for sure.
