OK first things first,this game is not the greatest game ever released.It will never win awards for graphics storyline or gameplay.It's really just another devil may cry clone yet even with all these stacked against the game it's still brilliant. Yes it may sound like a contradiction but this game really is fun to play.It may be repetitive and unoriginal but what sets this apart from most games of a similar nature is of course,Mr Bruce Campbell.Hell one of the only reasons that most people would have bought this game would have been to see Ash once again slice and dice whilst delivering the most cheesily entertaining one liners imaginable. Is this game worth 50 quid?No far from it,but if you pick this baby up second hand your in for a treat.The extras featuring campbell alone make this game worth buying
