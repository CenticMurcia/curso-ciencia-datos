This is my all time favorite movie. I have seen many great movies but Grease will always be the best. Yes its corny, yes its a bit pointless but that is what makes it so good!! If it wasn't for Grease John Travolta would not be famous, he would not have millions of dollars. Grease made him who he is today. The first time i saw Grease i fell in love with the movie and i fell in love with John. Every time i watch it, it just keeps getting better and better!! Long live Grease!! They have made those ridiculous High School Musicals now and that annoys me because they are trying to match up to Grease, but Zac Efron and his Stupid "Crew" will never be able to beat Grease. Grease is the best musical of all time. "Go Greased Lighting you're burning up the quarter mile" Grease is the word...
