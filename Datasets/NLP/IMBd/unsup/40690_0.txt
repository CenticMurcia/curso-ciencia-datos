Robin Williams and friends from the Second City gang take a vacation on the lovely, fictional isle of St.Nicholas (filmed in Jamaica) in the summer of 1985 and bring along Peter O'Toole, Twiggy and Jimmy Cliff. They even remember to make a feature film while they are there. Too bad they forgot to include more laughs. Sunstroke maybe? Enjoy the tropical locations and songs by reggae star Jimmy Cliff. The mindless and undeveloped story wastes a ton of comic talent. Fans of Williams and SCTV will get a kick of seeing all the comic actors in one place, but will be hard pressed to enjoy it. I think their home videos of the trip would have been funnier to watch. For some reason I find myself watching it every now and again.<br /><br />Turn your brain down to 'warm,sunny Caribbean beach' mode and just enjoy the few entertaining bits of this studio-funded holiday.
