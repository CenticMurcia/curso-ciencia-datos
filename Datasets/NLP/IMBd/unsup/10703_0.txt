Finally a movie for us: the people who were entranced by the romance of musical theater at a young age. This film captures the longing, the enthusiasm, and the emotional growing pains of a group of teen agers attending a performing arts summer camp. The musical numbers are simply stunning, often hilarious, and leave you exhilarated at the exuberant talent on display. And what numbers! Songs from Follies, Dreamgirls, Promises Promises, an incredible Bob Telson song (from The Gospel at Colonus)which opens the film, and several new songs written by Steven Trask (of Hedwig and the Angry Inch fame)and others.<br /><br />While the script remains frustratingly superficial when exploring the film's central romantic triangle, and in spite of its lopsided focus on the tribulations of the one straight male character, Camp still offers many characters and scenes that delight. And with musical performances this strong, any shortcomings are easily overlooked.
