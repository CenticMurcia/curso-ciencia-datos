This movie was pretty well done for a sequel.It has tons of drama, and romance. It felt at times like it was made for a TV movie. But if you like dramas or even a update on the people from "Terms of Endearment". This movie is a update of that movie. It was one of the best dramas I saw that year. The only problem with the movie is this, I wish it was a little bit longer. If you want to spend some time with old movie friends ,s ee this movie!!The cast is great especially Bill Paxton!!!
