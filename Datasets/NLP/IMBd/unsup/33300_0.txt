After 25 minutes, I said enough was too much. The leading male character is a borderline psychopath - he's obviously a domestic tragedy waiting to happen. All right, so he hasn't gotten violent towards his ex-wife yet. On the other hand he just walks up and belts her new fianc√© without provocation, but clearly feeling justified (and the film-makers clearly agree with him, which is the sickest thing about it). By the way, did I mention that she's his EX-wife? That makes everything he does in those first 25 minutes absolutely illegal - stalking; breaking and entering, assault, harassment.<br /><br />"Hey, it's only a movie!" Yes, and it's a movie with a message - "boys, you too can grow-up and get abusive to your wives;" and "girls, if he treats you like crap you probably deserved it 'cause he's quite a guy!" and "Children, even if your dad does desert you, you should love him and let him abuse your mom! He's still your dad." Oh, please! This is truly depraved.<br /><br />What the ex-wife should have done is shoved a carving knife down his throat - a decent lawyer could get her off easy. In any event, in the real world, the ex-husband's behavior doesn't get rewarded, it gets him tossed into jail - where he belongs.<br /><br />Technically speaking, everything else about this movie covers a part of the spectrum - the part spanning from scorchingly awful to mediocre-at-best. And just by the way, Sissy Spacek is about 10 years too old to play her part, and seems to know she's caught in turkey-land, but, hey, a paycheck is a paycheck.<br /><br />A real bomb.
