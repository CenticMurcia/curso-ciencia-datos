Martin(Hache) drawed the relationship between a father (played as a giant for Federico Luppi) and his son (beautiful Juan Diego Botto). The story runs towards Madrid and Buenos Aires, mixturing perfectly the lifes of four people completely misunderstood. I love this film, because I do. But what I love the most is the dialogues. Scenes that nothing have to do with the movie shows the magistral scripters selected for it... But I´d rather prefer the original version, it´s purer than English one. Perfect directed, perfect performances, Perfect script (with a capital P). Just sit down, relax, and learn. You´ll really enjoy it.
