You know, watch Julia Roberts in 'Erin Brockovich' than watch Meryl Streep here in 'Silkwood' and you'll become a film critic instantly. Meryl Streep is the character, while Julia Roberts is simply playing dress-up. I like Roberts in many movies, but not 'Erin Brockovich' which I found very flimsy and pandering. Kind of TV movie of the week. I'm bringing attention to this film because movies get lost very quickly these days, and this is a great one with first rate performances all around, including Cher and Kurt Russell. It works as a small town drama, a character study, and also has elements of suspense. Everything is pulled together neatly and tightly by Mike Nichols here, and the movie, despite the 80's haircuts and style, still gets you going today.
