There's a reason some films go "straight to video" instead of even making a brief attempt at theatrical release. This Steve Coogan mess is a perfect example. Let me save you ninety precious minutes of your life..skip this disaster.<br /><br />Steve Coogan, Rebecca Ramos, James Marsden, John Leguizamo, Debi Mazar, James Brolin, Sam Elliott, Henry Rollins... A Great cast totally wasted on a dull, by-the-numbers plot. You have to wonder how such talented people signed on to such a weak project. One can only guess.<br /><br />It's obvious most of the other comments are on solely to boost the rating of this atrocity. SKIP IT!
