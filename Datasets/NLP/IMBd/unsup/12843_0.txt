Have to concur with pythonking, a pretenious art house flop indeed ! Caught this feature at the Stony Brook Film Festival, last night. The "hollow" crowd reaction at film's end did indeed echo my own assessment of a cliche' ridden and drawn out relationship journey. I get the feeling that there may be more of a West coast-East coast dichotomy at work here. Free LOVE ( at a cost ! ), and a "lacking" morality.... when further delved upon , seem to stand out to those involved [like the brightest of highway billboards] , yet seemingly and blindly passed over by most of those involved , like non-stick teflon brain tissue ! Marguerite Moreau , although a talented actress , falls short in this faux pas , with a weak supporting cast. Again, perhaps us "eastcoasters" have a harder time grasping others missing the obvious and a lack of patience , there of. Gauged my own reaction to those of others in the mixed and diverse crowd screening it there. In discussion with many college students in attendance there, most left with gaping mouths, but waking up to the joys and truths of : Trust , family , monogamy & common sense and sensibilities ! <br /><br />
