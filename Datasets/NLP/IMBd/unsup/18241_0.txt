As a six or seven year old, I was glued to the screen every sunday night at about 8 o'clock. My favorite tv-show, battlestar gallactica, had something magical and cool (never heard of Star wars at that point :)). It had a lovable rogue in Capt. Starbuck and a guy we all wanted to be in Capt. Apollo.<br /><br />20 years later the romance en nostalgia rapidly wears of. I grabbed the DVD out of the sales-bin the other day, and watching it wasn't that enjoyable anymore.<br /><br />Spoiler!!<br /><br />First of, the plot and story are not that great. It goes wrong at the very beginning of the film. why in god's name would you leave your colonies unguarded, when you haven't signed a treaty yet. well, I would never leave my civilization for a shooting target, whatever the situation would be.<br /><br />/spoiler<br /><br />About the acting. Well, it's ok. The cheesy lines are acceptable, and Dirk Benedict is kinda funny, in his own, gambling and cigar smokin', kinda way. His character is based on Han Solo, as Apollo is a Luke in many ways. And so many Star Wars characters have a Battlestar double.<br /><br />Even for it's time the SFX are not more than ok, but the use of ordinary 80's 'earth' electronics to display the interior of the battlestar and fighters is more disturbing. It's a cheap production in many ways, which leaves you with the thought : has this production team got lack of imagination or money?<br /><br />-Spoiler- Nice easter egg: When the battlestar command is trying to help starbuck get back to the Gallactica, they take over his board computer, you can see it boot up and a command line appears saying "made in the USA.." - another sign of faulty and inaccurate production -/Spoiler-<br /><br />
