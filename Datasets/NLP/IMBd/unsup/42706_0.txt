Lets face it -- in this politically correct society we don't need to convicted felons out on parole for bootlegging a controlled substance riding around in gas guzzling bright orange hunk of junk with a racist flag painted on top of it Haven't we out grown the Dukes! ! ! for god sakes it 2005 - grow up<br /><br />But who are we kidding -Huh? - Of course we love the Dukes<br /><br />Actually I loved the Dukes of Hazzard ... I just didn't like either of the reunion movies. And No! ! ! ! I haven't out grown them at all - I look forward to seeing the 2005 big screen version of the Dukes with Burt Reynolds as "Boss Hogg"
