This movie is a sleek action spy cool girl film. Complete with its classic genre of gadgets and technology and whozits galore. Along side the action kicking kung-fu and gun fights of a Schwarzenegger film. Now with all that to compare it to you think the film would blow chunks. But it actually doesn't.<br /><br />The film is well put together. Basically two sisters take high profile contract jobs, corporate espionage, hitman contracts, etc... A new cop on the scene may try to take them out, but who is really working for the better cause. The plot doesn't try to be overly complicated but still is enough of a plot to keep the audience engaged.<br /><br />The action sequences are well shot and move fast and well. The technology of the cool watches and spy satellites isn't completely unbelievable and does actually add the appropriate amount of 'cool factor' to the girls and film. The story isn't anything overly complex or lower IQ simple, but does keep the viewer interested. Everything works just the way it should and it fits together like interlocking puzzle pieces.<br /><br />I expected this movie to be something akin to "Charlie's Angels" the first one. This movie is much better. If you were to compare it to eating different brands of ice-cream "So Close" would be your favorite brand and flavor, and "Charlie's angles" would be like a nasty banana split. Not to say "So Close" is completely mind blowing, but it does what it sets out to do and leaves you with an extremely satisfied flavor in your vision. A definite recommendation.<br /><br />One more thing the english dubbing of this film was quite good. Although the subtitles don't always match, the story line is still the same. You don't even need to have the subtitles on if you are lazy and just want to watch it in english you won't notice almost any times when the characters mouths move different from what they say.
