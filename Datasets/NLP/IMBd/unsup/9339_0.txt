I like James Cagney. I like just about all the other actors and actresses in this movie. I just absolutely, positively despise every one of them IN this movie. This apparently was a project by some of Cagney's family members. Honest, this movie is 'grates-on-your-nerves-annoying' just like having to stand in a checkout line while someone nearby talks on their cellphone. The story (or the sub-stories) are trite, annoying, irritating, and aggravating. Not one of the characters is particularly likable in their roles. Even Cagney is annoying but he has no choice other than to play his part in this bad, bad, bad film. Like I said, I like Cagney a lot, I even like some 'bad' movies which are so bad they're good. This movie is so bad, it is simply aggravating. I expected better than this; it was rated two stars and I thought 'well it must be a little quirky' and recorded it on the DVR. I may need to get my DVR fumigated. Have I made the point how appallingly bad this movie is?
