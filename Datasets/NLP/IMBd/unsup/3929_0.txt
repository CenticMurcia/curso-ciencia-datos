a fitting end to a funny yet dramatic trilogy. nowhere is the least serious of the three, and yet the ending was saddening. an all star cast, featuring sexy heather graham, carried this movie to greatness. director araki concentrates (as always) on backgrounds-especially colors, so be sure to take in the different surroundings while viewing this. one should also have a sense of humor as all kinds of teens are bashed with the witty araki trademark dialogue. dark is a true anti hero and while i personally believe the doom generation is the better film, james duvall's role as dark here has much more depth than the dopey jordan in tdg. enjoy it and laugh a little, can't you take a joke?
