I first started watching Neighbours when I met my girlfriend about 2 years ago because she watched it. Ever since, it has been attached to me like a parasite (along with Home and Away). First off, it has to be the most unrealistic show, along with the most annoying inlikable characters who act like complete and utter fairies, The same dialogue is portrayed in every episode. The acting is decent however, but thats not the point. The stories are like there from the another universe that would rarely come into another persons life. The character Zeke for example is the most head-wrecking person to ever exist,ever notice in every scene,all he does is complain,most lightly because he has never got laid, and he blames everyone else because of it. I don't want to express my hate, but I am, its a terrible show, just AAAAAAAAAGH!!. It makes me want to vomit over and over when people like this are licking each others a*s the whole time (Carl and Susan) One episode is enough for a lifetime, wait, no, one scene...
