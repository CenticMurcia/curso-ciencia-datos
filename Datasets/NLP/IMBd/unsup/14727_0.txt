When I first saw the promos, I thought it will be a desperate attempt of a veteran (Madhuri Dixit) to make it back. But, I just wanted to see if Madhuri Dixit has lost the grace and charm after the break. And I am really glad to say that she's still easily the best of actresses Indian Film has seen.<br /><br />The plot is not new (Swades, Lagan and so on have the same type of plot), but the way story was told was really good. There were times when they dragged the scenes a bit long. But only to emphasize on different emotions.<br /><br />In the End, the Laila-Majnu play was just amazing. The sets and the costumes were really good. We have to give credit to that. Although the music was not so great but was good enough to keep the audience in theatre. Kon Kona Sen Sharma was amazing. If you have to take names, then the list would not end. Everyone did their best for a movie that dared to showcase art. Two thumbs up!<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: Its a bold attempt to show the art as it should be and not attempting to appeal to the new generation. That is the best thing I loved in this movie.
