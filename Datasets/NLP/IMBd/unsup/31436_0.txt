Here is one of the great bad movies! A legendary artwork from the genius of Sam Raimi and beloved of myself. Terrific sight gags, a lean and mean Bruce Campbell as Ash, and soul swallowing demons! Ash and his woman Linda want some time alone so they shack up in a deserted cabin. Unfortunately it was being used by professor Knowby while he translated "The Book of the Dead" and when Ash plays the recording evil spirits are summoned. Having to chop up your girlfriend makes you a little loco and when demonic forces are screwing with you it just gets worse. About half the film chronicles Ash's struggle against insanity and the unholy terrors. When everyone else arrives they misunderstand the situation of course, heck - there's some maniac with a bloody chainsaw and shotgun in the Knowby's cabin. They learn soon enough Ash isn't perfectly sane but right on track with his assessment of the situation. Unfortunately the newcomers aren't the hardy breed though, and they fall one by one. In the end Annie is able to recite the passages to dispel the evil with her dying breaths but Ash is dragged through the time warp and into the medieval past. I really love this movie, the Hand is a riot! More movies should use the idea of the main character's hand becoming possessed and menacing them. Like... ..."Dirty Dancing!" Now what if Swayze's hand had become possessed and he was trying to deal with that while doing the Tango or something. Hey, what about "Forest Gump?" Hehehehe! (Say this in a Gump voice.) And mah hand was acting all funny like, it even tried to stab me. Momma never said nothing bout no hand trying to stab me so that jus didn't seem right. What it boils down to: If you have not seen this film you are missing out.
