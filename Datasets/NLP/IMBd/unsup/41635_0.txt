As an avid fan of JCVD, I was devastated after watching this film. It broke my trust in Van Damme as an actor (only to be renewed after watching Bloodsport-immediately after). This film was obviously before JCVD had any authority in the production of movies as HE would not put out such a poor movie. There were no cheesy comments, no little guys getting beaten up, no training montage, no solid soundtrack...all in all there was nothing. If you are a B movie advocate than you MUST watch this as a learning experience, if you are a Van Damme fan, then you MUST watch his for nothing else but to greater your JCVD knowledge. I don't even recall a token ass shot.
