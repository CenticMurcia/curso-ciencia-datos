In a small cabin, a scarred, long-haired psycho (who witnessed his mom getting doggy-style gang-raped and killed as a kid) lurks underneath the floorboards and emerges to cut up dumb college kid hikers. This is like a crude teen comedy mixed with a slasher film, complete with embarrassingly bad dialogue provided by the director. Tracy Scoggins gets good billing for a rather degrading cameo. Other name star cameos include Rance Howard as a one-armed white-trash gas station attendant, Bo Hopkins as (what else?) a sheriff who spends a lot of time driving and walking around in the woods, and Gary Busey as a strange guy who chops up chickens. It's not good, but it's at least a little different than the usual direct-to-video tripe.
