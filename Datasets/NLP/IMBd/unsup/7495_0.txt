This movie inspired me to read the literature of Anais Nin. In comparison of the books, i must say the actors portraying every person did an amazing job. they captured the pure emotional world anais nin wrote about. The relations between characters stayed true to life. I was especially amazed with maria demedieros who played anais nin. Fred Ward who id only known from Tremors surprised me as Henry Miller. This is a beautiful movie in every detail, staying true to the beautiful life it showed.
