"Cutting Class" does not deserve the cult classic status because it isn't. It came out when the slasher era was about to end. The movie doesn't offers anything you haven't seen.<br /><br />You got the typical plot where a killer on the loose terrorizes a college campus. You got the beautiful couple that survives the killer's attacks and manage to defeat him after following some hints. The sad thing is that the movie's killer is a geek. When this guy starts to act "psycho" the movie loses credibility.<br /><br />The fact that Brad Pitt is in this movie shouldn't be a reason to watch it (I talking to you girls!). This is probably one of the worst slasher flicks that came out in the 80's and that's something to say.<br /><br />Jill Schoelen is the best thing about the movie. She's super hot, sexy, tender, cute. Anytime she appears on screen makes me wonder about female physical perfectness. She's simply GORGEOUS. She's every guy's fantasy. And she delivers a decent performance. <br /><br />There are some gory kills but nothing you haven't seen. The scene I remember the most from the movie is when a girl (using no panties), goes under the gym's step staircases and gets stabbed. She screams as hard as she can but a band is playing on so her screaming is not heard. Classy. <br /><br />4/10. Don't waste your time or money on this. I was a victim of Jill Schoelen's screen charm. Oh, I would buy this movie a thousand times if she asked me to...
