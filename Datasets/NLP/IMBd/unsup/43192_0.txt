Rakesh did his best but he couldn't make it he need a lot of improvement. Story of this movie is good but if they used some technology then they would have make a spectacular film. "krish" is the second part of Hrithik's film "Koi Mil Gia" which got some good ideas and made good business. They got some idea from the English movie spider man but i did get it that spider man used the web to fly around the buildings but what did Hrithik use to fly and climb mountains like spider man. Krithik have done a good job in this movie. Rakesh should avoid from Plagiarism and should use some own new ideas to make a blockbuster film. But "Krish is a good time pass movie.
