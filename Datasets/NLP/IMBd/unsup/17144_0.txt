'Banzai, banzai, and see how you like it...' is the only line I really remember from this movie, but ironically, I remember many scenes. I saw it over and over again when I was around 9-11 (over 40 yrs ago), and would be interested to see how it has aged. I'm somewhat afraid that it would be laughable, but judging from the other comments, I also wouldn't be surprised to see the opposite. I most of all remember how it made the whole world war more real to me, as I watched youngsters my age fight the hated Japanese. <br /><br />The high rating I give it is based ENTIRELY on what a 9 yr old boy would have rated it back then, but it's all I have right now. So....has anybody anywhere seen this movie for the last 30 years, or know where to find it?
