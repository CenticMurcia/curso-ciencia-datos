I saw this movie in the year of its release. I have always been a great fan of Peter O'Toole and his performance in The Night of The Generals, as General Tanz is amazing. <br /><br />There are no weak performances in this film and I consider the story line to be sound throughout. The plot against Hitler's life - which is a well known historical fact, in no way detracts from the murder mystery at hand.<br /><br />The musical score associated with the film, composed by Maurice Jarre, is stirring and memorable. After more that 30 years, I still remember the haunting musical theme very clearly. <br /><br />The Night of the Generals is a terrific murder mystery. I hope that I will have an opportunity to view this picture again in the future. Sadly, it appears that it is now difficult to find.
