Well, it's quite interesting to watch this classic. The title of the film itself really catchy. Every segments of the film is "different", although it's related on sex issue. It's like been done by several directors. Here in "Do Some Women Have Trouble Reaching Orgasm?" segment you can see Allen doing homage to Antonioni and Fellini. The scene of giant boob in "Are the Findings of Doctors and Clinics Who Do Sexual Research Accurate?" is so wacky. The only Allen's movie that depicting clearly and hugely female breast and it's tits. Fall in love with a sheep? That's lunatic! You can see it on "What is Sodomy?" segment. The 'What Happens During Ejaculation?' segment is the finest and the climax. It tells that even a single sperm have consciousness to afraid being ejaculated. Although the story is not from Allen, it's Allen's movie with his wildest imagination.It's his real breakthrough.
