I remember Playboy magazine had a spread with Misty Rowe when this film was made. She recreated Marilyn Monroe's poses for the magazine and I wanted to see the movie because of it. I finally saw it on video. I wish I never did, it ranks as one of the worst films I ever saw. I mean total trash, no wonder it never got theatrical release.<br /><br />The movie is a retelling of Marilyn Monroe's life, I think it may have been adapted from one of the books that Robert Slatzer's (SLEAZER) published about Miss Monroe. You know him, he's the guy who claimed to have been Marilyn's confidant and husband for about a weekend. All his claims were never proved as a matter of fact his marriage claim was totally disproven when a check dated at the same time of their wedding and signed by Miss Monroe proved that she was in Los Angeles at the time. Even if it weren't based on Slatzer's (SLEAZER) writing it's just plain garbage.<br /><br />Source material aside it was the whole film was a mess. The editing looked jumpy, the acting terrible, the dialogue lame and it sounds as if everything the actors said reverberated on the wall. The film looked like it was shot with the wost film stock they can find. I think it may have been shot in 8MM, I mean it looked horrible. As for the casting, they casts "Hee Haw" Honey Misty Rowe as Marilyn. I mean I always thought Miss Rowe was a total babe but come on she absolutely look nothing like Marilyn Monroe. Then again Poppy Montgomery, Mira Sorvino, Asley Judd all played Marilyn and they look nothing like her. At least they can act.<br /><br />Two things that really stuck in my mind is the theme song, a soft rock/folk rock tune that went "Norma Jean wants to be a movie queen" and the other thing is when she finally gets her big break she utters the immortal words "I never have to perform fellatio again", except in a more graphic term.
