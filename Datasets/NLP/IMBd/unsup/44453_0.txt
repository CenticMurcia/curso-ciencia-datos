This has got to be one of the most pointless movies I have ever seen. Absolutely nothing interesting happens in this odd western.<br /><br />OK so the story is as follows; A very bad man comes to town, he rapes a whore, kills a couple of people and sets the town on fire. The rest of the movie focuses on the rebuilding of the town leaded by Blue (Henry Fonda), some whores and a couple of other completely uninteresting people. At the end the very bad man returns of course again (surprise, surprise!).<br /><br />The characters are absolutely the dullest and weirdest I have seen in a long time. Why should you ever care about one of them? During the movie nothing interesting happens and the movie leaves a very pointless impression. Even the finale is bitterly disappointing. And what message tried this movie to give? I'm still puzzled about that.<br /><br />Especially the scene's between Blue and Molly are horrible and have some awful dialog and silly moments that really don't make an awful lot of sense story-wise.<br /><br />No there's nothing to enjoy in this movie. The story is dull and the dialog and characters are ridicules!<br /><br />2/10
