Recap: The Second World War is raging around the globe. In a little town in California the war is nowhere to be seen but always present. Two young boys, Henry and Nicky, is about to turn 18 and is eager to be off to the war. Now, only a few weeks remain, and the boys have a lot to do before they enlist. Henry meets the beautiful Caddie, a girl he thinks is a little out of his league, in any case considering social status. Both Henry and Nicky are from lower working class, and considers the rich spoiled and like people from some other kind of world. Time ticks, and now they have to tie up all lose ends, which is not as easy as two teenager want them to be.<br /><br />Comments: The story, or rather there are not much of a story or a plot as there is life. This is a few weeks out of the two boys life, a time of much growing up to do, and a time of friendship without limits. So to speak the story is not very good, one might think. But due mostly to the casts ability to make it so real, so authentic, and so alive and feel so current even though the movie is filmed twenty years ago and set over sixty years ago. And then it hits you that the story is not bad either, because its never meant to be that kind of story that tell some events, its a story about life that everyone (more or less) can relate to. And viewed in in that light, the story is very good.<br /><br />But as already mentioned, its the actors and actresses, and their acting that really makes this movie worth watching. The friendship between Henry and Nicky, the growing relationship between Henry and Caddie feel very real. You can feel, more than see, the bonds between them. You can feel them evolve together, or just having a good time, or both.<br /><br />A young Sean Penn is magnificent in the lead as Henry. Its very impressive that an actor in the beginning of his career is able to make such an performance and carry such a heavy burden of the movie. He has good help though. A equally young Nicolas Cage plays Nicky, Henry's friend that has a knack for getting into trouble, and does it really well. He is the wilder one, compared to Henry, but would never fail his friend. And then, Elizabeth McGovern as Caddie. At the beginning of her career too, but already with a Oscar nomination behind her, she has the ability to pull off a very difficult part. The character of Caddie is a little in the shadows behind Henry and Nicky, but when called upon Caddie, i.e. McGovern really shines and interacts well with Henry, and gives him the reason to grow.<br /><br />It is very impressive that the director Benjamin and the producers dared to give all the leads to such young actors. Their trust paid off well though.<br /><br />Personally I also liked Henry's father, who had his own way of giving fatherly advice to his soon, but clearly also understood what he went through. A very sympathetic character. And also keep an eye out for a young Michael Madsen.<br /><br />So, mostly because of the acting (and in some part also the fun to see well-known actors in the beginning of their careers) <br /><br />8/10
