I agree with those who commented that "The Jar"(1964) was one of the best episodes in the Hitchcock TV series. I'm actually more a fan of those "tales of the unknown" type of anthology series,(like Twilight Zone, The Outer Limits, Night Gallery, etc.). Since Hitchcock's show always seemed to concentrate more on murder/suspense than the supernatural, I found this particular story to be a refreshingly creepy departure from all those Hum-Drum Who-Dun-its! I'm not saying that this story actually contains supernatural elements, but it certainly does suggest them. It was like watching some kind of nightmarish version of those 60's "rural" comedies, I loved seeing Mr Haney and Goober, and others trying to guess what was in the jar. (Heck, I almost expected Jethro and Gomer to make an appearance). Much like the characters in the story, the TV viewer finds himself literally glued to the screen, just dying to know what the heck that thing is in there! Now, I haven't seen this episode for decades and I would give my right arm to see it again, but alas, I can't locate a DVD or even a VHS tape featuring this lost classic. Can anyone help?
