I was in the 8th grade in 1969 and had already discovered the joys of motorcycles, owning a 50cc Roma from Italy for about a year when the show debuted. From the very first episode, Jim Bronson became a powerful influence on my young and impressionable personality. I am 51 now and have never owned a Harley, but over the years, more than a few have commented on my even temperament and controlled response to volatile situations. I thank God for an early role model like the fictitious Jim Bronson. If you've seen the series, yet not the TV pilot, Jim left San Francisco on the Harley Sportster vacated by his friend Nick's suicide. (played by a very Emilio-looking Martin Sheen) In 2000, I bought a dear friend's Honda Shadow V-twin 1100 cc (Sportster wannabe) and had some very memorable rides before parting with it in 2003. If all goes well, next year, I'll be replacing the bike with something similar and using my 3rd week of vacation for a Then Came Bronson adventure. Jim never rode the major highways, as I recall. He was never in a hurry and wouldn't have had the kind of encounters that the nation's back roads are much more conducive to.<br /><br />The theme song was a bit misleading; Going Down That Long Lonesome Highway, as it didn't appear so lonesome for Mr. Bronson. I highly recommend the show and the lead character's proactive engagement of relationships. Life is short, enjoy the ride!
