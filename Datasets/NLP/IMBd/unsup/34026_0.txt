OK, other than the few positive reviews on here (it's amazing that the producer could even talk his family members to get on here and write a positive review of this piece of dung), I agree with most of the things already said.<br /><br />Let me first say that I tend to enjoy movies that go off the beaten path - even if they are depressing and dark. I was drawn in by the cast, and the fact that it was the same author as Less Than Zero - which I thought was a very good film. This film, however, had "less than zero" redeeming qualities. As other reviews have mentioned, there is no story, no point, and absolutely NO REASON TO LIKE EVEN ONE OF THE CHARACTERS. Even the usually dependable actors seemed to mail it in for this effort, the script was horrible, and the cinematography went overboard trying to be "cool." Each one of the intertwining "stories" was repulsive and vile. (Kidnapping a 8yr old boy and keeping him in a bathtub to sell to some "bad guys"? C'mon). Shock for shock's sake is empty and vapid - which pretty much sums up this movie. I found myself hoping that all the stories converged on the same locale, and all the characters died in a fiery blaze.<br /><br />Don't waste a couple of hours of your life that you'll never get back.
