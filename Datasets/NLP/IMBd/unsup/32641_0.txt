Kal Penn is OK, but the rest of this is formulaic, inane (not in a funny way) and an insult to film. The story is predictable and there is nothing here that surprises or shocks. It is a copy of other idiotic films and it is a bit more idiotic, but less humorous, than the worst of the films.<br /><br />This is not bad enough to fit into the great bad film genre, with "Ishtar" and "Rhinestone" and Ed Wood's original stuff. It is just bad.<br /><br />Anybody can make a film now and anybody can write favorable comments. Probably the positive comments were written by those who stand to make some money from the rest of us renting this turkey. Skip this one.
