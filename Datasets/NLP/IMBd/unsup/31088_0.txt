This story follows Richard Eastwick through 3 generations of trying to better himself, and his family. Children, and wives depart many times before his life comes to an end, he seems to blame god for all his misfortune, and god does win in the end.<br /><br />We see drama through drought, famine, 2 wars, there is rivalry unsurpassed, and he has a poem, I only wish I could remember it to put on here that sums his whole life.<br /><br />I really do want to buy this film, so please if you have it contact me.
