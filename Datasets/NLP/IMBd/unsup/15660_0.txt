You don't often run into a director who can make an entertaining and genuinely humorous movie with so little cash. But with a small cast, some decent camera skills, and a few friends in the police dept, these guys made a film that's funnier than a lot of big budget comedies coming out of Hollywood. Is it polished? No. Does it look low budget? Yes. But much of the dialogue had me laughing out loud, and they even managed to create a staple character of sorts (youll know em when you see em). You even feel like you're along for the ride as their escapades escalate. Check this out if you're into humorous dialogue, smoking culture, and some very original and quotable lines.<br /><br />I just wish Turtle would have kicked some ass in the end, that would have been a hysterical scene.
