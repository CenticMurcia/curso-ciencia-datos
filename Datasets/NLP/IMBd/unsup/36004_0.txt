I can truly say this is the weakest and worst SH game yet in the series. It was -very- frustrating! The new 'power up' charge attacks are useless. You'll get whaled on by a monster every time if you try to use 'em. The female characters have been extra "whored-up". The male character extra "dumbed-down", (even by poor James' standards. Buffer does not mean better.) I can say that -any- game that makes you care for an extra person (tag-along female player) always annoys me, and Eileen was NO different. They should have taken clues from the newest Resident Evil (that latest tag-along gal DUCKS when you tell her to and automatically gets out of the way of the weapons when you're trying to attack.) All right: I still own it, and I even pre ordered this, since I'm a giant fan. I do play it, occasionally. The music score was great, as always. The details and monsters good...although I miss the -old-style- gum-heads and dogs. (Those ape critters got on my nerves with their screeching too.) The plot was good.<br /><br />As soon as Eileen joins my party though: ruined. I hate carting around dead weight like that. I found myself cursing more than usual at any time when I play a SH game, and the fun level deteriorated rapidly after she joined up with me. I simply play up to the part when she joins and then lose interest every time. There's also no good 'extra weapon'. The extra is...what? A weapon for, you guessed it: Eileen. Like anyone's going to dare equip her sorry butt with anything stronger than a purse. O_|| I gave this a 4.<br /><br />It's not even halfway up to par with the rest of the SH games, even the first, which I've played countless times.
