I've never been a fan of Disney movies including HSM 1. So when I heard about HSM 2 I knew it was going to be pathetic. My little sister begged me to watch so unfortunately I gave in. IT WAS HORRIBLE! It's made HSM 1 look good. The acting is bad and the singing is OK. OK, Zac Efron is cute, not cute enough to make this movie at least half way decent. If you want a good quality movie then it's best to not watch a Disney movie. They're so cheap on Disney movies and celebrities with no talent. And now they're having a HSM 3 that's coming out in theaters, that should be good;) HSM 2 should get a lower rating than 5.2. The only people who should be a entertained by this movie should be little kids. The producers, directors, actors, etc, are just trying go as cheap as they can go and at the same time make money off their viewers. If you want to see a real musical then watch hairspray (2007).
