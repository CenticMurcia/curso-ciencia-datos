Yet another masterpiece from one of the great indie filmmakers. Solondz again uses a lot of his trademark stark and unsettling characters to tell two separate stories. "Fiction" was short and to the point, the message being the utter subjectiveness of the art of storytelling. It was hilarious how the other kids in the writing class reacted to Vi's story, like it was improbable, racist and offensive. Solondz again displayed in this story that many people ARE racist and offensive, sometimes without even realizing it. It would have been impossible to make a whole movie out of "Fiction," and I think it was impressive that Solondz had the daring to just change over to another story without trying to link them, which would have been tedious. Solondz wanted to make two separate points, and the only way to do so was with two separate stories. The graphic sex scene between Selma Blair and Robert Wisdom is blocked out in the R-rated version; Solondz has a big red rectangle over the characters in a successful attempt to show how the MPAA censors can ruin a movie with their silly rules. I actually thought it added to the message of the first story, and the uncensored version is also on the DVD anyway. The second story is much longer and as a result has characters that are much more well developed. The Paul Giamatti character was a hilarious reflection of Solondz himself. Not just physically, but also in the way he was criticized for making fun of the characters in his documentary just as Solondz has been criticized for doing the same in "Welcome to the Dollhouse" and "Happiness." Many people who dislike Solondz films just can't stand the often vicious or disturbing denizens that inhabit his works. These people should stick to watching "Titanic" and "A Walk to Remember" as they have no appreciation for the daring and honest way Solondz makes his movies.
