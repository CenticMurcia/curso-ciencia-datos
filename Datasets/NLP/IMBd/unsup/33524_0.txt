This is an unfortunate film. One of its biggest problems is its lack of direction. Many of Schroeder's ideas are only half developed, and this lack of decisiveness shows. In a Q&A after the screening, Schroeder said that he did not want his film to be full of "Hollywood" clich√©s; unfortunately this is exactly what happens. As previously mentioned by my fellow critics, the hand-crank technique is used incorrectly and lends the film a music video tone. Add several non sequitur contrivances (e.g. the whole dog pound sequence(s) with its obvious use of stock footage, the way that Cameron receives funding for his film, the sabotage vignette, etc.) and you have a film that is chock full of holes. It also has a problem finding a true voice, which is something a film of this nature hinges on. It never sticks to one subject for long, and when it veers off in another direction, it fails to solidify into anything worthwhile. The one good thing it has going for it is Christopher Plummer. His performance is admirable in the way that he carefully delivers fairly pedantic dialogue. Although many characters were one-dimensional, the cast members did an adequate job. In brief, this is a forgettable film that will wow many people with its "heart." However, if you look more closely, you will see that it is shallow and mediocre at best.
