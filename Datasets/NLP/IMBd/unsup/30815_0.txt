People will hate me for this, but this was better than any of the seven movies. Unlike the crappy, crappy movie which shares its name with this brilliant piece by Genndy Tartakovsky. The animation was amazing, the storyline brilliant and the action is well distributed. By that I mean we get to see everyone fight, new and old Jedi and even stormtroopers.<br /><br />The story starts a little after where 'Attack of the Clones' left and finishes right after Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi are given orders to retrieve Palpatine from Grievous. That is where 'Revenge of the Sith' picks up. Also this is where Anakin's fall to the dark side truly begins.<br /><br />This is definitely more than worth a watch.
