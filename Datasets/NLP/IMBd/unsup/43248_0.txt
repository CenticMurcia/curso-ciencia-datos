Hey, did anyone notice that when they heard the cut off thing explode, they said we cant get out of here now. they blew it up earlier than arranged. when they were in the middle of the two dams, they pulled over to the side of the road before stopping, why would you do that when your the only ones left? And just when they were about to stop on the side, you can see one of the stage crew's arms in shot. An Negro wearing a white shirt with a watch on. He tells the car when to stop. Also the computer animated graphics are shocking, it looks like someone has created them through Microsoft Paint. Especially when the dam is blown. Then the different film footage of the dam over flowing.
