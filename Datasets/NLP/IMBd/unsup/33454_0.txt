After seeing only one episode of Lexx I'm convinced this is really not able to be in the shadow of the original and very witty Science Fiction series Red Dwarf. It amazes me how little is left of the original idea. The characters in Lexx are stale and shallow, the acting is not convincing and the jokes are not funny. I realize that this is a personal opinion, and perhaps a bit slanted because I am "European", and perhaps because I am such a big fan of Red Dwarf.<br /><br />The disappointment already starts in the beginning with the (clumsy) titles, whereas Red Dwarfs immediately takes you by surprise every time with it's starting melody and the really big space ship, with some tiny tiny men painting the giant words Red Dwarf on the hull.<br /><br />Holly, the board computer in Red Dwarf, is replaced by a non convincing robot head. Even when looked at as a series in it's own right, completely set apart from Red Dwarf, the series lacks both a good plot and convincing characters. Even the effects are cheap and not convincing.<br /><br />The only thing I liked were the original decors in Lexx. Why not buy the original script of Red Dwarf, hire a bunch of good actors, and try to make a good American version of the story?
