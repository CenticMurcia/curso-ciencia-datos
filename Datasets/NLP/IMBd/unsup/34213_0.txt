My dad and I were at the local video store trying to find something to rent when we saw this. The cover made the movie look fairly creepy, and the comment on the back "The most terrifying movie since The Shining" (probably by the director's mom) made it look like a decent movie. We were wrong. This is the worst movie I have ever seen, and I've seen a lot of movies. The acting is horrible, the camera quality is equally terrible, and I'm still not sure if I even fully understand the plot. But man was this movie entertaining. I love bad horror movies, but this one takes the cake. It was hysterical. We've got a homeless guy flipping the bird for 20 minutes....that had to be my favorite part. We have an old lady who apparently "forgets" to wash blood-stained bed sheets and leaves them in the hotel rooms. My dad and I were literally in tears throughout the whole movie. I would only recommend this if you're a fan of crappy horror movies that you can laugh at. If not, then this film would be a huge waste of your time and money.
