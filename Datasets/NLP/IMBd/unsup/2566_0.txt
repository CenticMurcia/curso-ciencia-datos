This is the best film i have seen in years. It left me feeling gutted and i have to say, in tears. It really brought back some rather shitty memories from my past. It's a film that makes you feel, and it makes you feel alive. And it makes you stop and think, and that is a pretty amazing thing considering the world we live in. It's raw and unforgiving, and it's to the point. If you want a film that will stay inside you for a long time, this is it. The images and the settings are truly beautiful. It's a breath of fresh air in the midst of Hollywood plastic productions. Love is not always pretty and easy, and this film will show you just how painful love can be. And what we are willing to do for the ones we love. I am still blown away.
