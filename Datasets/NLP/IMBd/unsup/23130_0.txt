As much to do with remembering a great summer, football provides the backdrop for this amusing comi-drama. Is easy to empathise with a fan getting caught up in the fervour of the tournament and his own fervour with falling for a woman (Rachel Weisz) who seems to mirror England's progress in the tournament.<br /><br />Weisz is as ephemeral as footballing success, particularly as she is a device and not really a woman in this drama, and footballing success is as ephemeral as happiness itself, so the movie reaches a predictable conclusion particularly if you know anything about the tournament.<br /><br />Weisz looks great, the movie has good pace, and it is well enough written to remind anyone of a great summer whether it involved football or not.<br /><br />Worth a look if it crops up.
