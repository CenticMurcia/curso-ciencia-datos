I liked this TV movie very much; it has touches of Mystery, Suspense and Drama all enveloped with Christmas and Family.<br /><br />Neil Patrick Harris does an excellent job and shows that he has surpassed Doogie Howser's shadow.<br /><br />Extremely heart-warming throughout, the interaction between characters is real, the writing and acting are all of top Quality.<br /><br />The mystery aspect that is the backbone of the story is well thought out.<br /><br />Possible Spoiler, sorry- fair warning!!!! Neil's character Will Martin, in his trying to discover the mysterious Lilly's identity by tracking down people listed in his Grandfathers journal's leads the viewer on an entertaining and heart-felt tour of small town middle America at it's best.<br /><br />This TV movie will leave you feeling satisfied and contemplating friends and family.<br /><br />I wish this title were available on DVD!
