I was only a 12 year old kid when I initially saw this movie on the first day of my summer vacation from school back in 1970. We laughed so hard throughout that I missed many funny lines. Since then I have seen this movie several times, and still find it uproariously funny. I am a Midwesterner who loves visiting New York City, so I do not believe it is a put down of the big apple, but simply a comic study of a trip where everything goes wrong for a very high-strung person and his comparatively passive wife. Lemmon plays this frustration beautifully, and the angry humor is as much cathartic as it is hilarious. While no cinema classic, it remains one of the funniest movies of its time, and one I enjoy upon repeated viewings.
