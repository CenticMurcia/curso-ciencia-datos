'Cannonball' tells the story of a motley crew of determined racers as they battle against each other in a cross country road race with no rules.<br /><br />It doesn't really need a plot. This film is about one thing and one thing only: cars, and the wondrous ways in which they can be wrecked. A year after Death Race 2000, Bartel and Carradine team up again here, probably just cashing in on the cult status of their pedestrian chewing masterpiece. Carradine plays a sort of anti-Frankenstein; Cannonball might be the title role, but he isn't as cool and devious as he was in DR2000. The supporting cast are all fine, keeping their tongue firmly in cheek and never letting the campy attitude of the film slip. But the cast in general plays second fiddle to the cars and explosions.<br /><br />Brains aren't required, but that only adds to the fun. It's particularly hilarious when the German driver gets blown up, and five minutes later someone is reading a newspaper with his death as the headline. The fact that the cars in this film tend to explode after colliding with something moving at two miles an hour tells you what kind of mindset you need to watch this. But if you don't laugh at the truly monumental, explosive pile up that takes place near the end of the film you need some help. Plus, watch out for the Stallone - Scorsese cameo that lasts literally seconds.<br /><br />If you enjoyed similar road racing classics like Death Race and Grand Theft Auto you should love this. Everything that is enjoyable about B movies is here, and I will never get bored of films like this.
