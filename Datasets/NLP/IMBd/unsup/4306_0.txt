This was the second Bollywood film I saw, and it remains at the top. It is a very basic storyline, but with amazing depth. It is the story of three friends, just graduated from college. Akash does not believe in love, and seems to facy himself a player. Throughout the film, you can almost see through him... he is afraid of being hurt. Sameer wants nothing more than to love and be loved. However, he is just as foolish as Akash, as he throws himself at all the wrong girls. Siddharth is the shy one, who seems to comprehend the complexity of love. When he falls for an older woman, he brings a new aspect to the story: love is selfless and asks nothing in return. Throughout this movie, you see these three stories develop, causing the audience to wonder, 'What is love?' <br /><br />It has been hailed as a hip movie with modern clothes and hairstyles. While this is true, it is also a highly artistic movie that never misses a beat or an opportunity for depth. An actor once said that an actor should be a person who holds a mirror, so the audience can see themselves. I hardly think it possible to watch this movie without seeing a little bit of Akash's cynicism, Sameer's naivete, and Siddharth's willingness to fight for love in ourselves. This is a must-see not only for Bollywood fans, but for hopeless romantics and cynics alike. This one will make you think.
