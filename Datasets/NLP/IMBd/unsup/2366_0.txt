I highly recommend this film. Some friends of mine got together with a tape and watched this with much anticipation. We were all fans of the Phantasm series. We were not disappointed!!! The original cast is back and Reggie is just as appealing as ever. The Tall Man can still deliver the looks that scare. This film was a bit more sophisticated than the previous sequels while not compromising any of the traditional fun, scares, gore or witty one-liners we come to expect from Phantasm. You won't be disappointed!!!!
