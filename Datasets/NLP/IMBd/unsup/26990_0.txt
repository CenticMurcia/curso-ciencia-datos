The Late Show with David Letterman is a show that has been on TV for way too long.<br /><br />It would be OK it was funny but I just can't find any good humor in this show.<br /><br />I find my self watching this show just staring whit out a smile on my mouth for way most of the time, thinking ohh was I suppose laugh there.<br /><br />I rarely laugh or even smile when I watch this show, which is very seldom , but I keep hearing certain people not all, saying what a great show it is. Even when there is nothing at all on TV it is still better than The Late Show. <br /><br />Little good to say about this show, and the top 10 list is not at all funny.<br /><br />People keep saying that the Late Show with David Letterman is so much better than Jay Leno, NOT. I will take Headlines over top 10 any day<br /><br />I give only 2 stars but I wonder why I give so many.
