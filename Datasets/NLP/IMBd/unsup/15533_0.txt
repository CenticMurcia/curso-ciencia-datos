I thought it was pretty good. I was surprised to see some people gave it a low rating and downright hated it. I would guess you have to be a fan of this type of genre. I think it should have been picked up by a network. I liked the lead actor Justin Hartley. I've seen his work on Smallville. In a pilot you are just looking for potential and I think the show has it. Ving Rhames and Lou Diamond Phillips were a nice touch. Ving Rhames did a good job and I would watch just to see what he can bring to the show. At this point the two female leads haven't done anything to stand out to me. The writing could be a little better as far as dialogue. You would think that AC would have had a friend or someone that he let know about his powers, but I think they were going to do it the way they did in Smallville with his friends finding out slowly over time.
