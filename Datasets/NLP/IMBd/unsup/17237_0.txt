I watched this miniseries after seeing the documentary, The Boys from Baraka. Damn, this entire mini-series is so depressing. I dreaded watching it, yet could not look away. I had to find out what decisions each person would make and the impact it would have on their lives. I really wish more of the character's back story would have been more drawn out and not shown in flashbacks that seem to last milliseconds. I'd like to have know the very moment Gary first picked up that needle, the day he and Fran split and more about Fat Kurt's past. The short flashbacks didn't do the story justice. Tears filled my eyes as the ultimate fate of Gary was revealed. The man had so much going for him at one time and could have very likely had a lot going for him again. He showed all the signs of wanting to give up the life, yet he did not. Just like the rest of the miniseries, this made me very sad.
