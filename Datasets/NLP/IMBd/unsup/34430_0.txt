1969, i was a young man of 16 years of age. to claim then, that Turn-On was the worst thing i had seen in my life may not have said as much. So, now, at a suave and silver 53, having seen and experienced such much more, what i'll say has more bearing. all I remember is the show was so fast it was over, and I mean over. It was all we howled about in school the next day. i cannot recall one line from it and aside from the comments listed here, some don't trigger any thoughts. i really wanted to know if IMDb had it listed. well, I found it. thanks, what I do remember was it was'not Laugh-In like, which was the attempt here. thanks again for the listing, of which i'll share with my brother.
