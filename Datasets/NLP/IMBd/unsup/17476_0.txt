When I was at school in my early teens, never a film was so much talked about after a weekend. The guys loved it, and one scene when they give chocolate bars to the soldiers, stuck to one's mind and one's appetite. I saw this film on DVD yesterday and either the chocolate scene was missing or unconsciously I slept through it. There is not much of a plot to the film, because it shows the real hero Audie Murphy in combat. But what great action scenes! The soldiers capturing a house in the field and then losing it, Murphy blowing a tank, shooting by mistake at himself in the mirror, standing on a tank in flames, throwing grenades at a pillbox, crossing a river under fire, whatever you think it is there, and in Cinemascope, which adapts very well to the widescreen format. We are used to see actors playing heroes, but here we see a hero which played western characters that could never be as brave as he was in real life. Everybody would think it is unreal!!!
