Trail of the Pink Panther (1982) - On 24 July 1980, Mr. Peter Sellers had past away prior to making this film. Sellers' third wife, Lynne Frederick, won a $1.475 million lawsuit against the makers of this film. She said the film insulted the memory of her late husband - I must agree! Sure there were some nice clips that made me chuckle, but really Mr. Frank Waldman!  (The screenplay writer) Mr. Steve Martin is scheduled to continue the Pink Panther crusade in none other than "THE PINK PANTHER" opening on September 23, 2005. One must agree, no one can put on the long pants Sellers pranced around, fell down and got back up in quite as well. Although, seeing Martin take on many characters he does have a knack of making a character his own. Perhaps he'll add some witty element(s) Sellers had neglected or the times would not consent to. (Unlikely) Or, perhaps Martin will create a new character using a template Sellers had developed. (More Likely) Bottom-Line: Maybe it's just me, but when a world-renowned physical comedy actor passes away it is insulting to clip together a film intern creating a mockery of what Sellers believed so hole-hardily in - an original honest laugh.
