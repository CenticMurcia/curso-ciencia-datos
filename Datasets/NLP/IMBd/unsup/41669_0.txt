Sounds like fun. Well it isn't. Location is great, actors are good (Keitel and Andie MacDowell) but there is no story, no plotline, nothing. Lets start shooting, who needs a story. Well, let me tell you, this movie was in very dire need of a story. Any story would have done, half a story would have given me a semi-enjoyable evening. I give you with 1/10 the first real dud of 2004. Should have gone to the party instead. 1-1-2004 02:45
