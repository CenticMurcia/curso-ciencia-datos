Just like Beldar's homemade fireworks display this movie may not make a lasting impression immediately, but give it a chance.<br /><br />The movie is a really fine piece of work, it's good for a laugh again and again.<br /><br />On top of that most (US) comedy actors worth mentioning are in the movie!
