A wonderfully filmed, deliciously scored and brilliantly acted contemporary thriller. Mark Harmon plays a private eye the likes of which hasn't been seen often and Mimi Rogers is perfect as the woman with the missing husband who hires him. The wonderful direction of Ivan Passer makes this a classic in its own right.
