Half way into this movie I began asking myself why I should care about Anabel Chong. I've seen several documentaries on the Porn industry and this is certainly not one of the better ones. It reveals little about the industry itself and yet it also fails to deliver anything more than a superficial glimpse into the world of Anabel Chong. Anabel is at once proud and defiant about her gang bang and yet deeply ashamed and embarrassed - to the point where she tearfully begs her mother for forgiveness and lies to her old teachers about her profession. Yet little light is shed on this contradiction.<br /><br />There are several scenes which, in and of themselves, sparkle, but they are lost in a film that has little structure and constantly struggles just to have a point.
