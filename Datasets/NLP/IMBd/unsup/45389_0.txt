The accolades for this movie are proof positive that the key to good reviews from pseudo-intellectuals and film critics is bombastic pedantry intertwined with flagrant homo-eroticism.<br /><br />This film heaps annoying precocious display upon annoying precocious display, culminating in the stereotypical homosexual fantasy: everyone desirable is gay or suppressing their gay tendencies.<br /><br />Most of the historical, literary and movie references will sail over the head of the typical viewer, which would be perfectly fine if the material were not so ham-handed, campy and pompous. A few good performances, but all-in-all a disappointing piece of gay propaganda.
