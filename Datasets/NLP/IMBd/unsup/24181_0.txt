I have just returned from seeing The Water Horse with four of my children aged 16 to 4. We all thoroughly enjoyed it. I have to say the beginning was a little slow as Angus found the egg, but once all the characters were introduced, and Crusoe had hatched, the plot revved along. The pompous Army Captain was fun to watch! The WWII surrounds were wonderful, all the casting was excellent- no wrong notes by any of the cast. The boy playing Angus was really enjoyable to watch. It was a "children's movie" but as a forty-something adult I was swept along into the adventure and enjoyed it very much. I loved how the plot was multi-layered and plenty of tension as Crusoe comes under threat from some trigger-happy army soldiers. I have to point out that Lake Whakatipu in NZ's South Island was used for a lot of the Loch Ness scenes so should get credit from those who loved the scenery! Bravo to WETA Workshop for the realism and believability of the water horse- just gorgeous! He/she has plenty of screen time too. This is a great movie for all ages. It is sure-footed and very enjoyable!! For Kiwis watching it's fun spotting familiar faces in the supporting cast.
