This is one of my favorite movies. I'm a little younger than Mr. Lucas but I find myself taken back to high school when I see this. Each of the main characters is struggling with the idea of their futures and what they ultimately value in life. In this movie you have all the usual suspects, Mr. Prom ,Mr. Gearhead, Ms. Easy. Ms. Perfect, Mr. Troubled, but somehow the fear and uncertainty of the future seems to connect them and they become stronger. There is a wonderful sense of community which is illustrated so well through the music and the almost fatherly figure of Wolfman Jack. My two sons just graduated from High school in '03 and '05. It doesn't seem as though they feel as connected to each other, everyone has their own personal reality. In this movie they all share this bittersweet night for better or worse and struggle with elusive dreams.
