The first Pet Sematary by the same director, Mary Lambert, is genuinely creepy and scary and contains couple of great shocks which stay in your mind. This sequel is much worse and was pretty hard to sit through when I watched it for the second time.<br /><br />Plot includes again a dead person who leads the characters to the mysterious cemetery from the first film, and soon they decide to try that wonderful idea of getting someone dead back to life with the "help" of that old burial ground which has been used by indians. What follows is human and animal zombies, couple of atmospheric moments and stupid gore. In other words, pretty lame a film.<br /><br />At times, the film is purely ridiculous and cannot be taken seriously. But the character played by the great Clancy Brown (Blue Steel, Highlander) is funny to watch and pretty effective "dead" man..But I can't recommend this to anyone real horror fanatic because most of the time, this is stupid and boring. And the violence tries to be more brutal than in the first film but it fails pretty miserably. I think it is stupid to make splatter films when you have to keep the R in mind..And horror film to be scary, effective and atmospheric, the use of effects is definitely not a must. See the first film and don't rush seeing this sequel.<br /><br />3/10
