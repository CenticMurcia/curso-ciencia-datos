I've watched this movie I found it was excellent. First of all, I love animals! I hate it when I saw the guy who lost the race killed his horse just because his horse couldn't take it anymore! I even get more sad when I thought Viggo is about to kill Hidalgo.<br /><br />I think personally Hidalgo is a very good and loyal horse and shouldn't be killed by his owner. However luckily Hidalgo stood up soon after that. :) About Viggo always trying to pretend to be tired, I think it's due to the hot and dry weather during the journey. I do pity the horse who actually do all the walking. I think on the overall, this movie is worth watching!
