I first saw this movie when I was 9 years old and it was the scariest movie I'd ever seen. I vividly recall the scenes of terrified people running from the monster and being melted by the radiation waves emitted by the beast!<br /><br />I watched the movie again last year and still found it compelling, albeit in a low budget way. I remember the sub-head, or perhaps the trailer to be "It came from the sea." Or, perhaps I was hiding under the sheets and didn't hear it correctly.
