ILLEGAL IN BLUE <br /><br />Aspect ratio: 1.33:1<br /><br />Sound format: Ultra-Stereo<br /><br />Suspended from the force after making allegations of corruption and impropriety, a disgraced cop (Dan Gauthier) moonlights as a cabbie and becomes involved with a beautiful young woman (Stacey Dash) implicated in the murder of her husband.<br /><br />Utterly routine 'erotic thriller', the kind of low-grade rubbish thats been gathering dust in video stores ever since the release of BASIC INSTINCT (1992). The film is only marginally redeemed by some extended sex scenes involving gorgeous Gauthier ("Tour of Duty") and delectable Dash (CLUELESS), both of whom generate a fair degree of heat under the direction of former hardcore specialist Stu Segall (who helmed the likes of PENELOPE'S EDUCATION, INSATIABLE and UP 'N COMING under the pseudonym 'Godfrey Daniels'). Aside from a gratuitous lesbian interlude (de rigueur for this sort of thing), the movie appears to be aimed at the couples market, which means there's an equal amount of male and female pulchritude on display, and it's a pleasure to watch these lovely young things going at it like jackhammers. Otherwise, this is the usual badly-scripted drivel, competent but uninspired on almost every level. Nice music score by Stephen Edwards.
