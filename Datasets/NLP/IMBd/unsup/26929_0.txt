This movie simply rocks. It perfectly embodies a gritty, street fighter-esque picture. The action scenes are absolutely amazing and a blast to watch. The plot is pretty good (not spectacular but definitely above average for an action film) and despite what some may say, Jet Li can do pretty good drama. Even though Bridget Fonda comes off as a weak, cry baby as she overacts her way through the movie, it adds another dimension to the action scenes to make them so exciting. This movie is for any action fan mild or extreme. Your heart will race, your jaw will drop, and you'll simply love this movie.
