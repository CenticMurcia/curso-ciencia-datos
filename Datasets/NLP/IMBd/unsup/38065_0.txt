A friend loaned this DVD to me, and I prepared to watch it not with any expectations of seeing a great or even good cinematic product, but merely hoping for a mild amount of entertainment.<br /><br />I was completely disappointed.<br /><br />This film possesses no positive attributes that I can think of. Everything from the costumes to the sets to the script was banal, brainless, and obviously churned out of the Hollywood schlock machine simply to make a buck on the names of the film's hapless stars.<br /><br />Three-quarters of the way through the movie I took to skipping 'chapters' in a vain attempt to reach a scene worth watching. Ultimately, I abandoned the effort.<br /><br />This is the kind of movie that makes one wish desperately for commercial breaks, so that one can have some kind of relief.
