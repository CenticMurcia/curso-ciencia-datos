"Songwriter" was one of the 1st movies I bought when I got my 1st VCR. Basically, Willie and Kris Kristofferson are playing themselves - and that's not bad. This movie is both funny, and heart-warming. You can't fault the music, and the acting's not too bad for a couple of songwriters. The plot is actually very basic - the big bad record company thinks it owns Doc (Willie), but he refuses to play their way. So he enlists the help of his old partner Blackie (Kris) and proceeds to find ways to get around his contract with the bad guys. In the process, he realizes that his 1st wife was his true love, and works to get her back. If you have any liking at all of Willie Nelson, you should enjoy this movie. My tape's about worn out...but there's no one quite like Willie.
