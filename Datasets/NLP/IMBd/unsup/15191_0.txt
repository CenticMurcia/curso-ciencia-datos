This easily one of the top 3 movies I've ever seen. GREAT acting from top to bottom, a great story line, editing, directing, everything. Russell Crowe deserves all the success he gets after this film - he was BRILLIANT. I saw it toward the end of its run, and boy am I glad I caught it while it was still in theaters.<br /><br />Also the movie poster is really cool, I'd highly recommend checking ebay or online stores if you're into that sort of thing.<br /><br />Off to see Traffic...
