In the depression everyone had it rough. This movie follows the plight of Mia Farrows character through her troubled marriage to Danny Aiello. Her only escape from an abusive and cheating husband is the movies. At one of her matin√©es she starts to communicate with a character on screen. The character, played by Jeff Daniels, breaks character on screen and talks to Mia. Soon he leaves the confines of the screen and takes off with Mia. Jeff Daniels, the actor now, finds out that his character took the unprecedented action of stepping offscreen. Without the Jeff character to act with on screen, the other actors just stop the movie, sit around and wait for him to return. The studio that put out the movie are shocked and need the character back on the screen. Everyone wants Jeffs character. Mild madness ensues. The end is very Woody. It ends the same way we live...with no happy ending. But this is the only ending that could work with this movie. It is a great movie, overlooked by most, but remembered fondly by those who have seen it.
