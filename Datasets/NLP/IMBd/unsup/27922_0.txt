My family and I watched this movie on HBO in the 80'S. We made a video tape and played it many times. It is the second best movie on our list. Treat Williams was great. It is true that people don't want to hear the truth because it is too boring. It has been interesting to see several of the actors and actresses from this movie come to life in later films. This always brought great memories of "Why Would I Lie" back to us. We loved watching it. We didn't keep the tape because we thought we could always buy a good one. We never saw one for sale anywhere. We have been searching in earnest first in stores and then on the internet and discovered to our dismay it was never recorded and sold as a VHS or DVD movie. We would love to see it again and will buy it immediately if it ever becomes available. Our number one movie we recommend is: "Somewhere in Time"
