Is Mr. Rex Hofman, the main character in this movie, totally mentally retarded and suicidal? Even though Rex is insanely obsessed with the disappearance of his girlfriend, why did he have to give himself up to a psychopathic killer and let himself be tortured to death? What did he accomplish? Absolutely NOTHING!! Unless a person is a psychopathic masochist, no human being in this world will ever do such a stupid thing!! Apparently Mr. Hofman is indeed a totally stupid, psychopathic masochist. I cannot buy the existence of such an idiotic individual on this planet, except in an insane asylum. Some IMDb commentators have complimented this movie as a good character study of a psychopathic killer. No, no. This movie is a character study of two psychopathic killers: wacko Monsieur Raymond, who kills others, and stupid Mr. Rex, who seems to enjoy killing himself. When a movie deviates from reality to this extent, it stinks. This is a rotten mackerel.
