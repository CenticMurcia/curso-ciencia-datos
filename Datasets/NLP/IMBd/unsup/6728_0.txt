This movie is by far the worst thing to come out since cats and dogs. I felt confused and disgusted throughout the whole bee experience. the dialect was dry and uninteresting. I was disturb by the fact a grown woman left her husband for a bee. Not only did this movie not have a plot , but it lacked any humor. seriously anyone who gives this movie any credit needs to get a life. obviously if you think bees flying planes or talking to humans is cute. the humans didn't even acknowledge the fact that they were talking to bees. they just went to court with them. yea thats really lame. know one wants to watch a movie about a girl and a bee in court making honey? my only question is how did this movie make theaters. I'm truly sorry for the people who have lost 8$. next time when you see a movie about bees and humans. Don't WATCH!
