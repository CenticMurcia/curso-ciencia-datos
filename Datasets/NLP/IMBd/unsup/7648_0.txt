This movie is not about action, it is not about special effects, it is about injustice. The persons portrayed in this movie did not die, nor did they suffer tremendous pain. But, for no valid reason, their liberty was taken from them because of the law instated to counter terrorist acts happening during "la crise d'octobre". You cannot compare this movie to a war film because it isn't, neither can it be compared to a drama because it is not that either. It is made in a documentary structure, sometimes showing us the people involved, sometimes, showing us the impressions of the actors playing them, and how they were disturbed by the whole idea.<br /><br />This movie is based on testimonies of people detained without recourse during the crisis of October 1970. This film is meant as a reminder for everyone that, as much a government can be civilized, as much it can abuse its power to protect itself with fear.<br /><br />If you watch this movie, do not expect twists and turns, do not expect violence, do not expect special effects... do not expect anything but humanity. The mere fact that someone can be deprived from freedom, even just for a few days, can leave a sour taste. I don't think this movie was made to be a statement, but rather to be disturbing, as the events it tells.
