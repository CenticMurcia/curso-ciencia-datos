Oh, God on a stick -- this is the funniest bloody movie. I mean, it demonstrates -- TO A T. -- word-for-word, attitude for attitude EXACTLY HOW MEN THINK ABOUT WOMEN. And why they would SO like to be us. And all the male attributes just boil through the costumes -- the bitchiness, the gossiping, the aggressive competition, the addiction to anything that comes along, the total lack of self control, the sensitivity to insult, the desperation for a mate, the desperation to be the only one on stage -- all of it so absolutely, totally male -- and the wish they could do like women do and DRESS ANY WAY THEY WANT (And you KNOW males would overdo the makeup just like that -- have you ever seen the hairpieces?). If you've ever wondered what makes your testicle friends, relatives or colleagues act the way they do -- you MUST see this movie! (Oh -- I should warn you -- this comment is NOT PC).
