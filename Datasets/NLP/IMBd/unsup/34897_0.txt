Is there a scene where the people don't act like unintelligent meat bags? All characters say "don't speak out a word!" and what is the reaction of the one stupid guy? He says:"I want to tell..." He is killed instantly. Just as he deserves it! <br /><br />And from my point of view this movie is soooo constructed. Any hopeless situation? Just wait a second, the rescue will appear. Conincedences as improbable as they may be are the big deal in the movie.<br /><br />To speak of the science-fiction part: The scenes in the laboratory are hilarious. The budget for these parts must be about 5$ or less. Oh wait, the scenes are obviously sponsored by Dell. <br /><br />And the transversal-through-time-action is... better not mentioned. Well, and maybe it's the German translation, but the dialogues are everything but smart.<br /><br />All in all, I would not recommend viewing the movie. The plot is good but the implementation is kind of careless.
