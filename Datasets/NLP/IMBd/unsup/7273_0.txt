Sweet con comedy that has so much charm and charisma that you will leave the theater overjoyed and wondering what you have really saw. Rian Johnson's shell game is a story is a attention grabber and boy does it grab you with captivating story telling and Oscar caliber performances. Adrien Brody and Mark Ruffalo play well as brothers and cons and display that affection with ease and style. Rinko Kikuchi is fantastic as their sidekick who always know how to make a scene even when she's rarely says anything and the real scene stealer here is the Oscar caliber performance of Rachel Weisz who not only manages to steal the movie but manages to steal your heart as well as a lonely heiress who craves adventure and she's gives the movie the same kind of adventure and fun that it deserves. She makes you follow her and have fun with her character as well, which makes going to this film all the much fun.<br /><br />If you want to waste your time and money on the so called "Blockbusters" with no heart and no sense of adventure, then by all means waste it. But if you want a movie that is intelligent, funny and have characters you care for, see "The Brothers Bloom". You will leave the movie theater with a huge smile on your face.
