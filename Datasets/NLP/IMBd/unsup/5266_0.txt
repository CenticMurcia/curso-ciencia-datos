I have to say i liked it a lot. The environment is well created, so are the dialogs and the ships. The special effects are pretty good, the dark atmosphere gives the movie a "grim and dark future" look.<br /><br />The only negative thing is the fighting scenes, they look just unreal and penalize the whole movie.<br /><br />The plot is simple, they travel through quasars to save the earth from a Killrathi invasion, these aliens look like big cats wielding some technologically advanced sticks. The cameras are always centered on Lt. Blair, so the shape of the Killrathi is shrouded in mystery until the third quarter of the movie.<br /><br />Overall it's a really good movie, with a great atmosphere that will make you say "Ok, i didn't waste these two hours".
