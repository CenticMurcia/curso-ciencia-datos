This is one of my all-time favorite Altman movies. Even though I was too young to have ever seen the O.C. & Stiggs saga in National Lampoon, I've been through two VHS copies of the movie. Dare I even hope that one day it might be available on DVD? I think hell would have to freeze over first. I had the chance to meet Daniel Jenkins about 12 years ago when he did a local production of Twelfth Night. Man, is this guy talented. I can't even remember how many different musical instruments this actor can play. I think my friend and I scared him a bit as we barraged him with ridiculous queries about O.C. & Stiggs at a question and answer session after the play. He's a teenage crush that has carried over for many, many years.
