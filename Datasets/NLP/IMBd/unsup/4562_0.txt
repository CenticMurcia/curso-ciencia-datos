When you look at the title of this DVD you think its a live DVD. However you will be very surprised. It contains interviews from the band members the videos from one step closer, crawling, paper cut and in the end. It gives you a great insight into life inside Linkin Park. It also has some interesting extras like Chester Bennington's Tattoos and what they represent and some audio only tracks like high voltage and my December. It also goes in great detail about the making of the in the end video. The only negative about this DVD is that although there are quite a few topics in the DVD they don't go in a lot of detail about them. Viewing wise if you like linkin park its worth a watch if your not a linkin park fan its probably not for you.
