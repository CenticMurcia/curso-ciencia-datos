This film is truly an insight to the mind of R.Kelly. The only thing I will give it is the singing ability of the cast; other than that...nothing. While watching this "artful" piece of ..., I was distressed to think that people could actually relate to this plot. Not only did the script completely lack any true depth, but also R.Kelly's performance as the singing narrator was accidentally comedic relief, as the whole film was, though not intended to be. When I realized that this was a serious movie and not intended to be as bad as it was, I analyzed a little more in depth the "intricate relationships, complex characters and general truths of life" as R.Kelly explains in the director commentary remix, or lack there of. This movie is entertaining for a few minutes, but for those of you who enjoy this movie and feel it tells about your own life; I am sorry, you are a deprived, uncultured, individual who lacks the ability for much thought at all. If you don't believe my statements take a look at the director commentary. As you will see, the mastermind behind this project avidly discusses what is written on the back of the DVD box which, though already unintelligent blather about cliffhangers, sounds dumber coming out of R.Kelly's mouth. If you disagree with me, or...you are R.Kelly, please attempt to deviate this post.
