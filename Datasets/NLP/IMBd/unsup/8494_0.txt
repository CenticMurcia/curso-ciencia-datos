A mysterious serial killer is taking out mob bosses one by one and Batman is pinned for the blame. Batman does more research into this mysterious figure but at the same time an old love interest of his comes back to Gotham, flashbacks of his past haunt him.<br /><br />This was a pretty well done animated movie, and certainly exceeds expectations. The relationships and psychological tones in the film are not low and does not disappoint, they should keep up the intrigue of the viewer to the max. It is also very mature and very graphic at times, plus twisted as heck. The script is pretty well-written and is quite clever at times. The voice acting is also fantastic.<br /><br />As a kid I always looked at this as more an epic to watch, it was so watchable and on top that the musical score is so addictive and beautifully dark, sad, daring, and sometimes heroic. RIP Shirley Walker.<br /><br />As I said before, it is a graphic piece of animation, very dark too, it's not kiddie and doesn't play along the guidelines of a "Family film" although there is no cursing involved in it. It depends on the child, yes, but I would urge that at a parent should watch this with a kid. It has both the appeal of what a kid wants and what an adult wants.<br /><br />Overall, this is fantastic. And definitely one of my favorite Batman movies.
