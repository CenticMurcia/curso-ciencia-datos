This movie plays more as a tool of propaganda for the US military, than presenting a good story with good acting and memorable characters.<br /><br />Instead we just sit back and are just watching things happen like a 3 minute news reel. You feel no sense of danger when the battles are ranging, you don't feel camradare for the soldiers fighting cause the actors are lame, you don't feel sadness when the soldiers die. We are forced to fumble along as the hero, goes from battle to battle and it's all the same. On top of that we have to keep hearing his humility in how he always says he's not worthy of being promoted. And of course we then hear all his buddies congratulating him. Over and over and over and over....<br /><br />It's like watching 4 year olds play cowboys and indians its bang bang your dead I won The End. And of course the only Native guy in the picture has to be refered to as "chief". There was ONE actor in this picture whose character was interesting and seemed like he would develop on in the film. But his presence and dialogue in the movie died (not cause he was killed) shortly leaving me more frustrated.<br /><br />The thing is there probably is a real story here but the translation just doesn't work in this film.<br /><br />Rating 3 out of 10.
