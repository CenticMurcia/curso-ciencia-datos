Some films are often a collection of associated scenes that are loosely tied together to advance the plot. The film story can be followed, but one has to pay attention to sort out the relevant stuff.<br /><br />In 1965, the story starts, two little boys explore a deserted town that is to be flooded. They find some strange goings-on at a church building, and -- spoiler-- one of them gets killed after freeing someone who's been bound. The other boy gets away.<br /><br />Then, there's a jump of 40 years. The "current" story starts with a TV reporter and a photojournalist (working on spec) covering the 40th anniversary of the completion of the dam that caused waters to inundate the abandoned town.<br /><br />The mayor of the town wants to use the 40th anniversary as a means to attract tourists, and sets a celebratory party for a few days after the action opens. So, as strange things start to happen, he wants them covered up with plausible cover stories.<br /><br />Strange happenings are followed by stranger things. The daughter of the lady TV person seems to be a focus of what's happening, and we slowly understand that she's been targeted by Mordecai Salas, the strange person that the one young boy freed. Salas, we learn, was an acolyte of Aleister Crowly, a notorious black magician of the first half of the 20th Century. He apparently learned the secret of a form of immortality, but his great drive is to bring back the evil practices that the flooding of his town had suppressed.<br /><br />The freelance photojournalist, Dan Quarry, eventually figures out what can stop Salas' program. He then takes action.<br /><br />The film story could better have been tightened a bit. I don't recommend this for the casual viewer.
