I saw this unforgettable movie more then 20 years ago and have never forgotton it.The movie, whos etitle I had forgotton until I found it on imdb is simply transfixing, it's to the movie's credit that with all the movies I've seen since this has been such an unforgettable one.<br /><br />The movie's phtography is absolutely beautiful(the boat and ocean scenes). The relationship between the couple is both tragic and fascinating to watch. If anyone comes upon this review SEE THIS MOVIE but be warned there are some:<br /><br />SPOILERS AHEAD-DON'T READ ANYMORE IF YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW!!!<br /><br />Not many spoilers since I saw the thing so long ago, I can't remember it scene by scene(except of corase for the FINAL scene!!) and will have to see it again. But I will say this: It reminded me just a tad of "war of the roses"(not alot but there was similiarities) but this movie was everything war of the roses could not possibly be.I have to watch it again and then maybe I'll post another review but anyone who likes tragic movies with beautiful photography and fascinating character development will probebly enjoy this.Unforgettable!<br /><br />
