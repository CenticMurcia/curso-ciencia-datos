I have seen the movie,In the Indian film industry the Tamil movies taking a good path, because of the creators as well as directors.The movie February 14 is simply superb, and the movie takes a beautiful love subject which feels a heart of love and romance. And the director controls the movie in excellent screenplay.And the cast performance is excellent and the animation character gives a grade for a entire movie.<br /><br />Each of the multi-ethnic characters is surrounded by irony, as each time a scene rewinds from another's perspective we find that the characters are not in fact what the other(s) perceive them to be, despite the actions that brought them to intersect.<br /><br />Thanks to director for giving a good movie like February 14.
