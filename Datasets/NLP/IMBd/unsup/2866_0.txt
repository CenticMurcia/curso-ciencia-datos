After reading a couple of comments on "Lenny", claiming "Unfortunately not very funny" I have made an effort to register on IMDb.com, just to give my view. To the people who wrote the words along those lines - Has it ever occurred to you, that Lenny Bruce's life is just not a very funny story? Yes, he was 1 of the best comedians ever, but did you really expect 2 hours of laughter, and than at the end, a little reminder that something went very wrong here - a tiny reminder, not anything to shake you up too much? Really???<br /><br />Yes, it is not very funny. If you decide to watch "Lenny", you will not get as many laughs, as you might have expected. I wouldn't say it is unfortunate though.<br /><br />What you will get is an accurate description of an incredibly powerful, real character. Lenny might not be the most likable hero ever, but he was a guy who stood up for what he believed in, and had a lot of fight in him. Don't we want our movie heroes to be like that?<br /><br />You'll get wonderful performances in the leading roles, a cinematography that each and every student of cinematography should be made to watch for hours, and Bob Fosse's direction, (helped by a modern approach to editing) simply stunning.<br /><br />You'll be moved, you'll get a lot of food for thought and you'll feel enriched by this movie. But yeah, you won't get many laughs. What a waste of time, right?<br /><br />Wrong.
