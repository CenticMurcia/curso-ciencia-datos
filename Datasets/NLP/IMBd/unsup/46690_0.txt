Oh dear. I watched this film because a colleague recommended it. I will have serious words with her next time I see her. Here's why...<br /><br />A good film can be let down by a moment in the film when you, the viewer, don't believe (or buy) the characters' decisions or actions. This happened in The Wrestler, when the main character 'forgot' to attend the dinner date that he had managed to arrange with his estranged daughter. However, I would say on balance that The Wrestler is a good film, as other aspects of the film compensated for this 'moment'.<br /><br />Right At Your Door, on the other hand is literally riddled with moments which made me question the characters' actions and decisions to the point that I was saying out loud, phrases beginning with "Why did he just...?" or "Why doesn't she...?" This kind of spoilt the viewing experience for me.<br /><br />Also, I can't say that on balance, in spite of these numerous confusing/irritating moments, that RAYD is a good film. As many have said, the idea is good, but the script is really weak. The 'twist' at the end of the film left me furious. I really did feel like I had wasted 90 minutes of my life. I wanted all the characters to die of the poison - along with anyone who had anything to do with the relaxation of this cinematic sludge.<br /><br />And yet, there are people and critics who rate this film quite highly. Perhaps you should see it for yourself, but by no means do that under my recommendation.
