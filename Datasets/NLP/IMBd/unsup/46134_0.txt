Some fruitcake is loitering around the streets of L.A. taking pictures of (ugly) wannabe models, all the while we hear a voice over narration as he muses about his ex girlfriend or ex wife- it's never made clear- and then strangles said wannabe models. This is occasionally interrupted by scenes of another ugly woman, who works in a used bookstore, stabbing bums to death on the streets with an ever handy switchblade. No explanation is ever given as to why this is happening, why the killings are being committed. <br /><br />Sleazy little movie looks like it was filmed in one or two days on the streets of L.A. and in back alleys and in old apartment buildings - maybe the crew just decided it would be cheaper to film this at their houses instead of on an actual set? There is NO DIALOGUE (!?!) just a narration added in after the fact and a lot of canned background music all jumbled together, and some of the dialogue is barely decipherable. That might make it worth watching in a "so bad it's good" kind of way, but if you're looking for anything more than that, steer clear.<br /><br />* out of ****
