This show was bad ass! It would've been so AWESOME if they could've been on TV for more than two seasons. The parts of season 3 that I've seen were even better than the first two (on average). Cripes, there was so many funny things on that show, I miss it big time. I just about loved every character, but especially Sifl, Chester and Stealth. It's great how they had guests on like the devil, God, his arch angel (let me give a shout-out to all my ARCH ANGELS IN THE HOUSE!!!) Michael, Earth, Mars, the Sun, and jeez a whole lot more I can't think of now. When Chester beat Grout on Trivia Trapazoids I just about crapped my pants. "Why? Why?" Of all the songs they did, my favorite was when Olly just got back from Seattle and did that bad-ass punk song about how "HIS SO-CALLED LIFE IS JUST LAIM!!!" ROCK!!! That show rocked.
