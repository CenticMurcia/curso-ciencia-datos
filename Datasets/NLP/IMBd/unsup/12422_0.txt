This is a great movie... I think that all the actors and actresses did a very good job!... go see it! I think that Jesper Asholt did the best part!.. you can't tell if his like that in real life :) but i know he isn't... because I know him! then there is Iben and Anders who is unbelievable good actors! I just loved the movie.. a great little lovestory! I can't say that much about Emil playing Livas little brother... I can only say that he is NOT like that in real life... because I also know him! :) .. but i believe it was a great role to play and I think he did it good!<br /><br />Best regards Emil Tarding
