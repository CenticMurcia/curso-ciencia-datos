A mockumentary with an alternative history twist. Great idea, but the execution was incredibly poor and lazy.<br /><br />The acting was simply horrible, probably among the worst ever seen outside 50's B horror movies. I kid you not. <br /><br />The pacing was awkward, if this was a real documentary, nobody would go through its painfully boring parts.<br /><br />Whoever wrote this has absolutely no knowledge about history. Sure, the message is valid... but the movie doesn't seem convincing at all. A lot of the events are so poorly thought-out, they only become annoying.<br /><br />All the major events in US history are there, only with a little twist, sadly, the 'twist' has no grounds in reality ( even alternative reality ).<br /><br />Final verdict: 2/10, only because the idea was good.
