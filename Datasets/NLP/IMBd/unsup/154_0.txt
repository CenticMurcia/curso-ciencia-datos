Being a fan of comedians such as Laurel and Hardy, Marx Brothers, and various other comics from that era...I watched this film wanting to give Wheeler and Woolsey a chance to prove to me they belong among the aforementioned. I found their style of humor very dull, the jokes were lame and the accompanied antics similar to that seen from a hyperactive pre-teen. The storyline was somewhat inventive, and would have worked much better with a more talented duo. The sole reason to watch this film would be to see Thelma Todd, and Dorothy Lee. Perhaps I need to watch a couple more Wheeler and Woolsey films before I cast them aside, but I can almost bet the other offerings would be simply more of the same.
