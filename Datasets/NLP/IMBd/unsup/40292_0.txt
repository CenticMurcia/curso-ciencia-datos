I have been viewing the great detective on film as a progression, through the years, since the early part of the 20th century. I'm sure it was fascinating for readers of the stories to watch our hero develop, and there have since been countless literary expositions on Holmes and anything accompanying him. It has likewise been a lot of fun watching different portrayals on the screen.<br /><br />I have enjoyed the Eille Norwood productions immensely, and of course can strongly recommend Messieurs Rathbone and Brett in the role. Other commendable cinematic or televised Sherlocks include Charlton Heston, Peter Cushing, Christopher Plummer, Nicol Williamson--a lot of good men have played Sherlock Holmes.<br /><br />But this one is the very worst one I've seen, except for a short burlesque by Douglas Fairbanks Sr. Mr. Barrymore shows zero intellectual processing--that's right, none. He is in a daze. Can you can imagine Sherlock Holmes in a daze? I understand he was intoxicated for most of the production, and it shows. If he was a great actor, he was a pitiful interpretor. I would doubt he ever read a Holmes story.<br /><br />The film has some good features, as delineated by Mr. Morris in the review above this one. It is of some historical interest. It might even be a fairly good movie of its day. But, when laid beside The Hound of the Baskervilles starring Jeremy Brett, you have a turkey.
