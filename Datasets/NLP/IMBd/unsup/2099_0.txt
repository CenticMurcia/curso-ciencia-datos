Chaney Jr was a great man,he actually started me on horror films,and made me read the Steinbeck classic. Well I love this film. It is amazing. It`s got a great story,follows the novel very carefully. And it makes you care about the characters. Chaney shines in the best role of his career. Where he isnt a ghost or goblin,not that is not bad. Great movie!<br /><br />4/4
