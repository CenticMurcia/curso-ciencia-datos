Many of you and I know about the Mystery Science Theater 3000 episode featuring this excuse for a movie. Despite it's horribly chosen character names and WWF volunteer extras, MST3K has naturally found a way to make it watchable for any human.<br /><br />1. ROWSDOWER: This is not a name for a Canadian or anybody for that matter. What it should be: a canned food item, a curse for teenagers, a type of soup, a nickname for a sports car, or even a name for a high school dropout.<br /><br />2. World Wrestling Federation: Did they help make this film? A lot of the cultist looked like lower class wrestlers that don't get much screen time on the actual show. Well, now they have about 50 minutes of screen time.<br /><br />3. The star's exposure to the viewer: What is he? Pretty much a loner kid who exists before the popularity of the internet. That's why in the movie he's being chase by some random cult in the outskirts of Canada. If this movie was made in 2008, it would star the same kid, but it would be about a cult started in World of Warcraft instead of some lost civilization.<br /><br />4. CULT LEADER: What a funny guy to look at. Constantly changing hair styles, deeper voice than Satan, wears a coat from Ross, and isn't really important until he dies.<br /><br />5. The old/wise man named Pepper... What can I say, the guy lives in an old crap joint in the middle of somewhere and eats rat droppings for supper.
