Here is another rarely-seen anime film I had watched online, and after I did I love it. it's a beautifully-animated fantasy about two star-crossed lovers from opposite sides : Fire & Water. You know, I didn't know Sanrio, creator of Hello Kitty (and all the other cuddley characters we love) maded this film; but now I do.<br /><br />The feud between Fire and Water started along time ago, when the two siblings, Oceanus - God of Water (Sirius' father), and Hyperia - Goddess of Fire (Malta's mother), lived in peace and dearly loved each other. However, the God of Wind, Algaroc, become jealous of the pair's happiness, and spread lies and deceit between them until their hatred for each other brought about war. Finally, Algaroc was imprisoned by the King of Gods himself, but after that time, the brother and sister still despised each other, so the Children of Fire and Water forever remained apart. Years later, Prince Syrius of the Water and Princess Malta of the Fire meet and fall in love, and they meet in secret.
