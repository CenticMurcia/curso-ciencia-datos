I knew this movie was going to be crap when I saw that it had been filmed using the same handy-cam that I use for family events. The acting was really bad and at times made no sense. The only scene that I thought was remotely worth watching was when you briefly see the "Killer" in a flash of cheesy lightning. I would only recommend this film if your only other entertainment option was watching paint dry, and even then you would had to tick me off really bad. I personally can't figure out how there could be a sequel to this movie. There was nothing worth watching the first time what on earth could have inspired the second go-round?
