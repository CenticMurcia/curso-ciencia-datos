I hate to say the ending is a little bit cliché, however, the movie is cliché but amazing ! I had seen another two movies of Eytan Fox and Gal Uchovsky's before this one, both are "gay theme", both are amazingly good. I said it because I didn't expect that much from the movies, I never thought they share a same rhythm of the aesthetics with me, a person from a totally different culture background. I found it easy to understand and it arouse resonance, unlike some middle east movies. It is very inspiring. I also recommend it because it is not a shallow combination of gay love and war, but a profound discussion of joy and death. And there's one more thing, very good taste of music showed in all of Eytan Fox's works, "good" here I mean "goes on very well with the movie", the overall ambiance. Specially in the last few minutes, when Yossi was watching Lior's photo in which he was dressed as a bunny rabbit, he suddenly shocked by something, Lior told him about the picture the day he died. I noticed Yossi's complicated feeling, he even smiled. At first I couldn't understand his smile when looking at the picture of his dead lover. But, gradually, I came to feel what Yossi felt, Jagger never left his life, and what we were expected to remember, was the joy that Jagger brought to us, with his passion to love and life.
