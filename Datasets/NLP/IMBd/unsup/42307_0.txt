So bad I'm not sure where to start. I left the theater wondering what the hell I'd just watched and where the hell it'd come from. Case in point the burrow being destroyed was a completely pointless scene that could have been removed so as to make time for actually important things like Dumbledore's ideas as to what the horcruxes could be and even the significance of their existence and the number 7. Voldemort's past is glossed over completely as if they just expect everyone to have read the book before. How Harry and the others will even know what to look for in the next movie I haven't the faintest idea. Much of the movie is centered around the teenage relationships and it just drags the entire movie down with a lot of unneeded fluff. I know that the story's supposed to be about Harry growing up, but there's too much of an imbalance between relationships and the rest of the plot.<br /><br />Then there's the acting which still needs improvement on the part of the younger actors, especially Ginny who's acting was completely wooden for most of the film. The only part which I thought was actually decent was the scene where Harry took the felix felicus and was completely loopy. Otherwise it was just plain bad. The adults continue being the only people who can actually act in these movies, although Slughorn seemed a little off, he was better than the youths.<br /><br />Overall, this movie just continues the downward spiral these movies have been in since at least the second or third film, and is easily the worst yet.
