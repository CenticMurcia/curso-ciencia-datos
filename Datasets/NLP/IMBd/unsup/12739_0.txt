This movie captures the beauty of Ireland and the magic of the Irish to create a enchanting story. The actors and actresses give stunning performances and repeatedly throughout the movie I had to remind myself that characters weren't real. I loved this movie so much that I have watched other movies about Ireland and based their merit upon this exceptional production.
