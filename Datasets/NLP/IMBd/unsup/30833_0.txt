Nearing 15 years later and I CAN remember many of the skits and shorts. The movie shorts by Shawn Alex Thompson were brilliant, My Beautiful Cigarette(might be My Lovely Cigarette) and Patterns were my favorites! Sketches like the Sesame Street parodies, Oopsy Digit, The Association for Apathy, Hooked on Phonics, not to mention Tommy Blaze's rants, were sooo good. Wish I could find the complete series to purchase!! It was on at one o'clock in the morning on what was then The WB-channel 11. I didn't and don't understand why that time slot. I think that is why this show didn't make it, because The Newz was as good as Kids in the Hall and much better than Saturday Night Live.
