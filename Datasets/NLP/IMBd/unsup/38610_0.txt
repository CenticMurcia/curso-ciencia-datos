You know a movie cannot be too good when the headliner is Ayre Gross. Best known for his role as 'Gordo' in the stinker "Soul Man", Gross doesn't impress here. Playing David Crowne opposite a rare pre-Friends cinematic appearance by Courtney Cox, Gross painstakingly delivers his dialogue to the audience. Kevin Pollock and Julie Brown are simply not funny.(this begs the question: when is Julie Brown ever funny.) The characters constantly pan to the camera as if to have conversations with the audience explaining their predicaments. Pollock's character, Eli, is a rote "Ladies' Man" while Julie Brown plays 'Zoe' thus accentuating her quirkiness. I ask myself was Judy Tenuta too busy during this shoot? Zoe's role in the movie is the zany-yet-supportive friend. Cheesy lines and generalisations about the Boston singles scene abound. Women are objects and men do not fare much better. The movie attempts to analyse all the phases of a relationship, and barely achieves its goal; I would recommend you turn the opposite way when you see "The Opposite Sex" on tv or the video rack.
