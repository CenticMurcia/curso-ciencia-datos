I am a fan of both drug and prison movies so when I was recommended this movie I had some pretty high expectations. I read a lot of reviews on here and it seemed that people felt this was an accurate portrayal of prison life. I have never been to prison but I highly doubt that many of the events that happened in the movie could occur in prison. The one specific scene that I am talking about is the near riot. The other problem I had with this movie was the overuse of Latino terms. I understand that these terms are used in real life but every other word was "essay"(sp) or "homes". This wouldn't have been such an issue if the movie at least had some action between long drawn out conversations. The action was few and far between and I found myself dozing off many times. The thing that bothered me with this movie was the lack of a score. There was little to no background music to set the tone of a scene. This left the movie with a ton of awkward silences with the actors standing just making a silly facial expression for minutes at a time. So if you are looking for an action filled drug movie I'd look elsewhere but if you are looking for a way to waste 2 hours of your day I'd recommend "American Me".
