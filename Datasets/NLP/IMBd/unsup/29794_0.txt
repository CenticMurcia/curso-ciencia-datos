Chris O'Donnell and Gene Hackman are true to the roles that they are portraying. At least they have every appearance of how I would see those kind of people in a trial. I have seen trials in person and in the media too. The K.K.K. own south and a man or a murderer. O'Donell is adamant and totally focused. The hatred is furious and blinding, as these not-so-good-Ole' boys gather, fight and even kill, under the belief of ' Racial purification '. But Samuel Kayhill (Hackman) is not what he appears to be. But as his time in Prison is coming to an end, the big 'ending', death, his grandson Adam Hall ( Chris O' Donell ) is running in fast motion to try and bring about an appeal, from the Govn. or a 'Stay' of execution. <br /><br />The performances are gripping and powerful and the directing is detailed and well crafted. <br /><br />I recommend this prison drama for drama and racial issues and a superb story.
