This was one of the four or five worst gay movies I've seen, down there with "Surge of Power" and "Latin Boys Go to Hell." It's a little better than those because of two competent performances by Ryan Carnes and Emily Stiles. The others were usually wooden, but they couldn't have been much better with such a cheesy script. The character Kyle needs to be sympathetic, but has to deliver too many cheesy one liners and throw so many little drama fits that the plot hardly justifies. The movie has enough cheap laughs to get you through it, but you feel dirty at the end for having laughed. It falls into the category of not bad enough to walk out of, but not good enough to have shown up for in the first place. I'm very lenient with a movie that tries for something but falls short, but this one doesn't try for that much, and still doesn't achieve it.
