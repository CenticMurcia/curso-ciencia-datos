Way before Three's Company, there was Tale Of A Dog which was one of the last of these underrated MGM Our Gang classic shorts. Buckwheat sees friend by the name of Bigshot who is sending a nameless dog away because his dad doesn't have enough food for him. Buckwheat convinces him to have the gang take care of him and call the dog smallpox because of his spots. Here is where the situation begins: Mickey, Janet, and Froggy hear about it, they take it literally like most kids do. They hear that Buckwheat has smallpox and will give it to the gang. They panic and make several phone calls which leads a city wide panic. Pure misunderstanding that makes stuff like Three's Company funny and so does this. Again, I give this 10 out of 10.
