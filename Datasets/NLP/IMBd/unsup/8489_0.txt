Batman: The Animated Series was one of the best animated shows of all time. It was one of the cartoons that defined the 90s and, thanks to that very animation, will eventually become a timeless classic. Mask of the Phantasm was one of its defining moments. An executive decision to put the film on the silver screen instead of straight-to-video or leave it for the time slot on television shows how good this really is. And for any Batman fan, this is simply not-miss stuff. An alternative take on how Batman found the Bat-Cave and put together his suit, topped off with one of the definitive Joker appearances and, simply put, Mask of the Phantasm is a must watch film for any fan of Batman, animation, movies, you name it.
