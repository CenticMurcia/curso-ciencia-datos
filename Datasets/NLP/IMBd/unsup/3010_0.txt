This seems to be a "I get it and I like it", or "I don't get it and I thought it was weird" sort of movie.<br /><br />The best thing about this movie are the actors, they all do an amazing job.The stand outs being Bill Murray, Willem Dafoe, and Anjelica Huston.Close seconds to Jeff Goldblum, Owen Wilson, and Cate Blanchett.<br /><br />Look at that cast! you know you are in for a treat.<br /><br />The next best thing about this movie is the kooky story and underused but amazing stop motion aquatic life. Very cool stuff.<br /><br />The story had it all, from revenge, to a lost Son, to pirates, to love stories and jealousies, to redemption.<br /><br />Wes Anderson is a good movie maker.
