I like APHC (except the music) but was bored to death by this movie. You would think the movie would be at least be as good as the weekly show. Not so, not so. Guy Noir was flat and lifeless (and I like Kevin Klein), the jokes were slow and poorly timed, there were no serials, the letters segment was extremely short, there was no "sermon". Did it take more than five minutes to write the plot? I was expecting the usual APHC bits and got nothing but old, old, old country music.<br /><br />If you like old country music you will love this movie. If you are expecting a shining example of the weekly show, you will be disappointed.<br /><br />Edward
