For those who have not seen a silent film, try this one. Douglas Fairbanks shows off great silent acting & fantastic stunt work in a very entertaining film. This is the type of film that should be pulled out when someone wants to do a theater organ score with a silent movie.<br /><br />There is a very good reason this film is great visually and clever with special effects. The Director is Raoul Walsh who is one of the great Directors who has gotten more recognition in recent years because of his great body of directing work. This version has been overshadowed by the 1940 version done in Technicolor with Sabu, but once you look at this film, you will realize this film is great in its own right.<br /><br />Julanne Johnson, a very busy actress in films until she retired in 1934 does pretty well here in the female lead. This is Raoul Walsh's 49th film directing & it shows in how well the cameras are used in this film.
