While I truly enjoyed the first movie, this one stinks, I mean really stinks. The only returning character is the guy playing King Edvard - everybody else ran a mile when they saw the scripts for this, what a joke and a bad one at that. Where is the continuation of the story? why is the father alive and well when he was dying in the first movie which is why the prince couldn't have a normal life and had to come home to save the monarchy. It really is abysmal when you get morons making a sequel (and heaven forbid a third instalment, this time the actor playing Edvard has gone and is played by someone else again) which they proceed to ruin completely. Did they not see the 1st movie, were they unaware it is a sequel and understand what a sequel is - a continuation????? No, they did not. How these fools ever get the money to make rubbish like this is beyond me. It tarnishes the memory of how good the 1st movie was, what a shame the fools who made this couldn't even be bothered to do it right.
