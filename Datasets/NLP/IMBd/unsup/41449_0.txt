The most boring film of 2007, and one of the most boring films of all time.<br /><br />First Born starts slowly and then...becomes even slower...and then Zzzz. What!? Oh, I'm still commenting. Yes, well what can be said...a seemingly normal woman (Laura) goes completely insane after giving birth to her first child, a girl, if that matters. She is too wealthy to get any serious attention, so everyone lets her aberrations slide, not wanting to confront her, especially those who could be of most help to her.<br /><br />No matter what is done to assist Laura, things just keep getting more and more out of control. Even as her personality is making major changes (she starts smoking) no one stops and says; "Hey, you're acting weird and freaking everyone out, including yourself." <br /><br />Any real help comes too late and still no one is confronting the real issue that Laura is insane, not depressed, insane. So what happens? She buries her baby girl alive (thinking it was a doll), and forgets that she even had a baby. So now she is completely delusional and forever insane. The End.<br /><br />Really. The End.
