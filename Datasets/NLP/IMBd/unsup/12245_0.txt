Unfortunately for there is no shortage of these so-called film makers who travel to Thailand with preconceived notions and return with a poorly researched self-indulgent piece about (surprise) prostitutes. Leaving aside the overly melodramatic narration, the way that the narrator/director mispronounces many Thai words and shows an alarming lack of local knowledge, I saw no attempts to check the stories he was being fed, and no background information was looked into to validate the stories he reported. The narrator just accepted everything fed to him as fact.<br /><br />Had he talked to people who know Thailand he may have discovered that the hard luck stories are par for the course, and as was shown, when the subject finds they aren't going to be making any money off it, they tend to stop answering the door.<br /><br />Nice try, but this is just another inexperienced director who did nothing to back up the veracity of anything presented, though stories about prostitutes always sell don't they?
