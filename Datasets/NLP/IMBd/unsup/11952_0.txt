This is one of the best martial Arts films I have ever seen, mainly because of the 1st rate skill of all the main characters. This is not a film you watch for it's plot or acting but if you want to see some of the best martial Arts ever filmed then this is one film you cannot miss. Wang Tao makes this better than the 2 sequels and his talent is exceptional, so much sop that I puzzle over why he has not been in more films? John Lui is his usual 'North kicking' Best and Hwang Jang Lee as Silver fox is outstanding. This is one of the few Martial Arts films that rivals Bruce Lee films for pure skill ( with no special effects or wire work ) My copy is very poor quality and I hope that someday I can get a better DVD of this wonderful film.
