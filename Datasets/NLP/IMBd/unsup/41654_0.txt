This is a really, really bad movie. I'm watching it right now on TV 'cos it's too hot to sleep (typical Aussie summer, wouldn't ya guess), and, it being the summer "silly season", the networks have pulled out their big guns - namely, lower-than-C-grade movies, which basically constitutes the entire Aussie industry.<br /><br />Even by summer non-ratings standards, this is pretty horrific. Simply, it's another victim of shoddy Aussie writing, bad, bad direction, and normally very good actors doing a damn fine job of being terrible. I don't even remember this film being released commercially, so it's probably some commissioned TV movie that somehow got the green light and is now languishing in the perpetual darkness of a station's archive.<br /><br />Oh well, maybe we can hope they're only going to screen it once every silly season. The world can only be a better place if it never again sees the light of day. Bonza.<br /><br />And that is my two cents on another sterling Aussie gem. Chuck us another shrimp, because this one's well and truly over done.
