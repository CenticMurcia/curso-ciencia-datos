GETTING STRAIGHT is the most hippiest movie I've ever seen. The story is so lame and the acting is awful(especially Elliott Gould). The diologue is so corny that it's sad and painful to watch and listen. The only reason I saw this movie is because it had a young HARRISON FORD play a small part as one of the hippie students on campus. It's kind of funny seeing Harrison Ford with long hair trying to be a hippie. His performance was good for the time he's on screen but not even that helps this movie out at all. What really ruins this movie is Elliott Gould's over acting! It's so annoying watching him criticizing everything and everyone that you just want to punch him right through the screen. It doesn't matter what every other user comment says about this movie, don't waste your money watching it.
