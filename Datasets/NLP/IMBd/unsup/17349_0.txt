I have always loved Al Pacino, ever since seeing his early films in the seventies and early eighties such as Dog Day Afternoon, The Godfather, (parts 1 and 2)And Justice For All, Author! Author!, etc. The only early ones I haven't seen are Serpico and Cruisin', but I've enjoyed them all.<br /><br />I really liked this one too, it was sexy and suspenseful and the music made me jump at several moments. As for the love scenes, I'm sure that Mr. Pacino was in his forties by this film and Ellen was much younger, but their scenes together were quite steamy. And the surprise ending, well...you just have to see it to believe it. It wasn't The Godfather, but it was dam good. But then maybe I'm just a sucker for sad-eyed, medium statured Italians. I recommend this film for diehard Pacino fans.
