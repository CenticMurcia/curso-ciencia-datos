Thought not as high on the "sleaze-scale" as notorious CATIII "classics" THE UNTOLD STORY, RED TO KILL, or THE EBOLA SYNDROME - ESCAPE FROM BROTHEL sure tries hard to wallow in it's rating, and does a damn good job...<br /><br />Two parallel story lines collide when a guy living on the Chinese mainland is called over to Hong Kong to pull a job with a few buddies to rob a jewelry store for the store-owner's boss to get the insurance money. His girlfriend lives in HK, but turns out she doesn't work at the factory that she claims to, and is actually a prostitute. The jewelry store job goes wrong when one of the robbers shoots an interfering tourist - and are then double-crossed by the jewelry store owner. Our hapless mainlander is the only one to survive the set-up, and goes looking to his girlfriend for help. He finds her, and realizes that her career-path is not quite what she had led him to believe. Of course he's upset, but he has bigger koi to fry - like getting out of HK alive - so the couple enlist the help of her ex-husband to smuggle the fugitive back to China. This also turns out to be a set-up - and the ending is not happy for the two luckless lovers...<br /><br />ESCAPE FROM BROTHEL, and most CATIII films in general, are not to most "casual" or "mainstream" film viewers tastes. Tons of sexy full-frontal and soft-core sex, some good violent scenes (including a kung-fu battle with a nekkid chick that is off-the-hook...) and an extremely downbeat ending don't make this one the feel good film of the summer - unless you're like me and live for this sort of trash. Again - it's not the best of the genre - but it's definitely one of the better ones. Essential for CATIII fans...8.5/10
