I saw "Double Harness" for the first time yesterday. At first, I was expecting what I call the usual 30's drama, with lots of tuxedos and evening dresses and maybe some weak humor. But what I found was Ann Harding, a beautiful and very talented actress. Her understated delivery and honest portrayal made me want to see more films with her in a starring role. As one reviewer has pointed out, William Powell was on his way to "Thin Man" fame, but what became of Ann? She easily could've gone toe to toe with the other great ladies of film from that time, but we see little of her today. She is a delight to watch. Thanks to TCM for showing "Double Harness" to keep Ann's memory alive and well.
