Captain America is good movie. All of the cast was good and the characters were used properly. It was funny that Melinda Dillon and Darren McGavin were in another film together. Matt Salinger played Captain America very good and Scott Paulin played the Red Skull excellently! It was unusual to see Ronny Cox as the president and Ned Beatty in yet another superhero movie! Very good directing by one of the most underrated directors Albert Pyun. I really don't know what is so bad about this movie. Sure its not like the current Marvel movies but this was made a long while ago. If you like Marvel Comics, Captain America, and the cast mentioned above then I recommend you watch this movie!
