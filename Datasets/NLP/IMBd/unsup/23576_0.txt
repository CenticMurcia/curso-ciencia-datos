Hello and welcome to my first review. Let me start by saying that the movie is not worth watching unless you see the IMAGE DVD version. Any other version is missing half of the movie and has bad image quality and incorrect tints. For those of you who are unfamiliar with movies from the 20's, this is a silent film which means there is a musical track playing throughout the film to match what is going on and in some cases sound effects. As far as tints go, unless everything was done in studio where the lighting and other effects could be controlled, the technology at the time only allowed for filming during the day so different tints were used so show that it was daytime/nighttime, indoors/outdoors, and other events. Since the actors did not have dialog in silent films, they had to over act a bit to show you what is happening. Inter-titles(written speech/narration) cuts in and out of the film. Let it be known that this means that you have to pay very close attention to a silent film to fully enjoy and understand it.<br /><br />The movie was made in 1925 and runs 93 minutes. The restoration involves the combining of 8 versions from around the world to give you the most complete version possible making this film one of the best restorations as of yet. The IMAGE DVD contains two musical scores, outtakes, audio commentary, and a reproduction of the original souvenir program in print where the insert is contained. I don't want to give anything away from the movie but I will just say that this is the first of the large monster movies and is the framework for any other movie of this kind without question not to mention that this movie is a masterpiece. Watch it a few times before you make your judgment and you will see how great it is.
