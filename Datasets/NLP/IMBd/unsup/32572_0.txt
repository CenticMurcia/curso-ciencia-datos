Happy, crappy "feel good" (it made me feel bad) so-called comedy(I thought comedies were supposed to make you laugh?) I come from Northern Ireland and I found this leap upon the peace process band-wangon condesending and feeble. Even the great Billy Connolly and the gorgeous Anna Friel can't save this turkey.....avoid.
