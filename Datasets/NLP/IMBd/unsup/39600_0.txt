While this film does have some interesting ideas (vampirism as an addiction), the execution is horrible. The narrative is practically non-existent (and needlessly overlong and confusing). The acting (except Duane Jones) is horrible...the actors blow lines right on camera! The dialogue is almost impossible to hear. The whole thing comes off as very amateurish. Not recommended.
