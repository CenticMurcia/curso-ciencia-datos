Not sure which movie rstone and prake saw, but it couldn't have been the same one I did. To be fair this movie probably isn't everyone's cup of tea. It's not a 'Fast and the Furious' action film. It's not a 'Quantum of Solace' suspense film either. It's about a guy, Andy - played by Jay Baruchel, that has thrown his life away by getting hooked on gambling. Baruchel plays the part with the same desperation of addicts striving for one more fix, be it a drug, alcohol, or gambling. And he nails the way that his character seems to point the finger about the way his life turned out everywhere but at himself. It's also about the guy , Rueben - played by Quaid, that takes the job to kill him. I won't lie and tel you I came expecting anything other than am action suspense flick. What I found instead was a story that was marvelously crafted in the 78-odd minutes. I became immersed in it. I cared about the characters, the loser Andy and the rough breaks he had that really just came from his own actions and choices in life, and the solemn enforcer Rueben, tasked with killing someone he knows but determined to give him one chance to, in an hour or so, to make something good. You get some humor, some gun play, but instead of relying on the quick and cheap thrills to make his point, the director relies on the way you are invested in the story to make the film. And you do become invested in it. Maybe it's just that I lost my wife in Dec 2007 to a one car accident that makes me a little introspective when it comes to movies where impending death is the main theme and your choices or ability to choose what you do with your time left are integral to the story. I might not vote this one number one for 2008, but it would definitely be in my top ten. And it was definitely worth the watch.
