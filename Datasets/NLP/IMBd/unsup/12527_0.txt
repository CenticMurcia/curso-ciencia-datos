I watched "Down with Love" first and that was a really good movie. I recommend watching it. Stars Renee' Zelwinger. After that went of...I kept the channel on and watched "Grace's Choice". Boy am I glad I did. Kristen Bell does an excellent job in this movie. Kept my interest thru the whole thing. Everyone in this movie does a great job in their respective parts. Its about a teen that has to do the right and impossible thing to keep her siblings together because of their irresponsible mother. I plan on finding the book or article this movie was about and reading it. Does anyone know where I can find it? My email is ronsbrat525@aol.com I recommend this movie to everyone. It is well worth watching!!!!!!
