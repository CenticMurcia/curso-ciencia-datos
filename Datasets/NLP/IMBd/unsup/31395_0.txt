"Comandante was an excellent documentary, full of interesting images and information about the figure of Fidel Casttro: his day by day, his thoughts, etc. But Stone made a big mistake: he let himself get seduced by the huge charisma of the Cuban leader (something that's pretty easy, nobody can deny it) and he forgot to tell about so important issues such as the Cuban dissidents, or the fact that in Cuba there's not freedom of speech at all. With "looking for Fidel" Oliver tries to fix that, he's interviewed several Cuban dissidents, their families, and has asked Castro about the last executions in the isle and stuff...<br /><br />Now, here comes the big question: why are the USA so obsessed with Castro while they form alliances with dictatorships that are much more harmful than Cuba's such as Morocco, Arabia Saudi, China, etc.? Why do they criticize Castro if they supported Pinochet, Videla or Batista? You don't have to answer... I already know why.<br /><br />*My rate: 7/10
