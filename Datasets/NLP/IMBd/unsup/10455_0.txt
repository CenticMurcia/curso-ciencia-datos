He's probably one of the most underrated actors out there. Maybe because he chooses quality independent films and not the big money movies? I dunno, but I think he's great. And Trees Lounge was one of the best movies I've seen in the last three years. Great acting all around, Debi Mazar, Daniel Baldwin, Anthony Lapaglia and CHLOÃ« SEVIGNY. Check out PALMETTO for more of her.<br /><br />10/10 I give this movie
