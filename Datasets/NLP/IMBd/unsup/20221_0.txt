I saw this on T.V. and was fascinated by it. I'm not a fan of "hip hop" because I think it is a degenerate art form created by an oppressed people. However this offshoot, Rize, I think is culturally deep and relevant. It's a dance expression (along with the "tribal" markings)from black folks African ancestral memory. It's a dance that is similar to the continental African ethnic expression of their connection to Nature, but Rize is more angry and rightly so. Rize is the Black Americans expression of its connection to the ills of white supremacy and their disconnection from Nature. The dance is their angry reaction to it both.<br /><br />This is a great example of the ancestral spirit of Black Americans and why an African centered view will serve us well in the United States.
