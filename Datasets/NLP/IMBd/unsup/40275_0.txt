well, since you're reading a review there's bound to be spoilers. but i might as well issue the warning anyways. but its not like i'd be ruining anything. the plot is predictable.<br /><br />an asteroid hits the ship, oxygen supplies are lost, the entire crew cant survive the trip. one guy decides to go on a rampage. how original.<br /><br />the effects are awful, the acting is often clunky, the plot is inconsistent.<br /><br />it is, however, a good time waster. IF you have absolutely nothing else to do. 3/10
