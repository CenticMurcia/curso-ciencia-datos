Based on the excellent books (themselves based on historical fact and rumours) I, CLAUDIUS and CLAUDIUS THE GOD by Robert Graves, this series is surely one of the best dramas ever filmed. The plot concerns Emperor Claudius compiling a warts and all history of his family, starting with his grandfather Augustus, the first ever emperor of Rome. Made in 13 50 minute episodes, unfortunately the only bad thing about the show is the rather cheap BBC production values. This is salvaged by the incredible acting, with only one poor(ish) performance in the final episode. With lashings of black comedy, debauchery, incest, murder, insanity, suicide, orgies, back-stabbing and adultery I, CLAUDIUS is unmissable. John Hurt is especially good playing the unhinged Caligula, plunging Rome into new lows of extreme sexual depravity and fear alongside his sister.<br /><br />A truly moving drama (notably the last episode) everybody on the planet should see this show. It's that good. Trust me!
