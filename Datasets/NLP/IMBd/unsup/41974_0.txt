Warning: Some spoilers for those who wish to see this garbage.<br /><br />The worst film ever! I have seen many films in all my days, but this was particulary horrible. It was unprofessionaly done, it had no glamour in any of the scenes, it seems like no one wants to care whatever they making a movie or just reading their lines. The beheading of the boy jumping around in a sack is so obviously faked. For god sake, the head looks like a pice of painted plastic! I hope this will never be remade, none trying to copy!
