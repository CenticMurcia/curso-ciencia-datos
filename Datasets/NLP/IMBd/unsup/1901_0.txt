i was listening to an overachieving radio show called Jake and Jackie one of their blow hards recommend that people go out and see this movie. let me just say it was god awful if anyone likes this film they clearly have the IQ of Paris Hilton on crystal method.<br /><br />Personally if i were you i would stay away from this movie. Robert Altman a really great director but he really s'd the bed on this one. Instead of seeing this everyone should go out and see broke back mountain gay cowboys are a much better watch. hope this helps and i hope this doesn't turn you off of altman's films. Jake and Jackie i hope you appreciate this
