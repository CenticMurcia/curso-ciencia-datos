One of my earliest memories is watching this particular version of Robin Hood on television. Even then the quality, the characters and even the music stuck with me (it has one of the most perfect scores ever composed!).<br /><br />Years later, after seeing it countless times on video, I saw it on the big screen when it was shown locally, and it was a whole new experience of the film. Seeing it with a crowd that was enjoying it with me, the families that had brought their children, the applause at Robin's first appearance and at key moments of the film (which I will not spoil for anyone who has not seen it) added to the joy and excitement at seeing it in a theater.<br /><br />If you have never seen "The Adventures of Robin Hood" then do so as soon as you can, show it to your kids and, if possible, see it on the big screen. You will not regret experiencing one of Hollywoods finest achievements!
