I'm not familiar with the works of Charles Bukowski, on which this film is based, but still, it's rather interesting, if strange. Harry Voss is a young fresh-faced boy, who is learning from an older friend about women. The first segment of this film is a bit like a "coming of age" story that's probably a bit racier than most of its type, but then it morphs into Harry as a teenager, with hideous acne and wanting to stay away from others because of his horrible complexion. He does manage to get a dance with the girl of his dreams though, by wrapping his face in toilet paper. By the third segment things have gone downhill considerably, as Harry is a drunk who has a reunion with an old friend (who has also fallen on hard times) and for "old time-sake" they steal a body from an ambulance and find that it's a beautiful young woman, and things degenerate from there. The ending is both beautiful and horrifying. A very strange film from Belgium, in Flemish with subtitles. Apparently Bukowski's work is based in the L.A. area and this has been translated to European locations but works quite well. Not exactly the type of fare I expect from Mondo Macabro but still not a bad film. 7 out of 10.
