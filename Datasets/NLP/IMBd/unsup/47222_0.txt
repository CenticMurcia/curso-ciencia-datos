Okay, so it's not Shakespeare. I still say it's better than any movie with Pauly Shore in it (I realize that's not much to live up to but still). If you like B movies, you ought to see this. The acting is pretty awful/hilarious, and Clint Howard turns in a classic performance as the whining sidekick of the tough hero. Carol Alt is not too bad (for a supermodel... better than Cindy Crawford in FAIR GAME anyway!) and Ron Perlman is sufficiently evil as the bad guy. I don't know why Morgan Brittany was in this though since her character didn't really do anything of any importance. I guess she's friends with the director or something.<br /><br />My favorite line: "Now I'm infected too! Til death do us part..." Any part with the C-list actors trying to explain virology in scientific terms was pretty good as well.<br /><br />4/10. Funny stuff.
