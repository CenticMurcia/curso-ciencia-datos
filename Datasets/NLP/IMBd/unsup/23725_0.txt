Okay, could this be dumber? This is like a R rated version of a Disney film. We have to save the TV station Johnny. I like the concept, but it never got off the ground in this film. The acting is beyond bad, the script, well, if I wrote it, I wouldn't admit it. And I tried, but couldn't count how many stupid stereotypes were in this film. And these people keep saying "ANARCHY!" and then preach the 1st amendment. Anarchy is a state of lawlessness and zero government. Therefore, no 1st amendment. To preach both is to be a contradiction or hypocrite. I knew the ending of these film about 10 minutes into it. And how do these kids running "Anarchy TV" get any money? None of them seem to have a job. Taking it's a public access station. The parodies they tried would have been good, only they weren't funny. So, if you enjoy bad acting, bad script, stupid stereotypes and zero original thoughts in your movies, than this film is for you. 3 out of 10.
