If you do not care about quality acting or cinematography, this movie might just be for you. If you love cheesy characters who are anything but believable, this movie is for you. If you love the cheesy plot structure of a Disney movie and consider yourself to be intellectually worthless, you're only a ticket away from mindless bliss. If you find overweight goth girls attractive, well... you get the point. There are several 'fight scenes' in this movie which look as realistic as Sonny beating up Carlo in the Godfather. Note that this movie was made in 2007. Charlie is able to trick his 'psychiatrist' into prescribing him all manner of drugs. Somehow his psychiatrist doesn't see a problem with Charlie taking drugs for almost every defined psychological disorder. I wonder if he got his degree at the same place as the director. Life as a high schooler is portrayed in an absurdly clich√© way. There is a bully, a drama geek, a suicidal kid, and of course a principal. The principal is the most unrealistic character (aside from Charlie) in the movie. The principal is an unrealistically normal person until he decides to get liquored up and fire a pistol into the sky above his suburban neighborhood. Of course Charlie dates the principal's daughter. You can't have a cheesy movie without the father vs. boyfriend and principal vs. mischievous student relationships. In the end, the moral of the story is "Hey! Charlie Bartlett is just a kid! You can't expect much from a kid, can you?" Whatever kid has the charisma and public speaking skills to influence and control his flock-of-sheep high school class isn't a kid to me.
