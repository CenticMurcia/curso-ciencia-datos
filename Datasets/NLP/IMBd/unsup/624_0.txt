"A Day with the Boys" by Clu Gulager follows a group of boys as they are playing war games of childhood.The boys are only playing:burying the adult character/businessman alive after quick execution.Suddenly the camera is panning to reveal that they have killed others.The grave of the victim is marked with his suitcase and there are three similar graves marked with their own deceased occupants' emblems:an umbrella,a basket and a child's doll.Gorgeously photographed by Laszlo Kovacs "A Day with the Boys" looks like a painting with freeze-frames and dissolving images.The innocent darkness within children is stunningly revealed.An unsettling and poignant work of art.9 out of 10.
