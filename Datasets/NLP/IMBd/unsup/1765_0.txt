Its truly a RPG. I remember the day i bought this game. I told to myself,"Wow, what a tittle, Final Fantasy, i should try to play this game". Yes, i'm only 9 yrs. old when i bought and finished this game, and its my first FF game ever played. And now I'm 14 yrs old now. I like this game. It change my personality a lot. Its a good game with many emotions attach to it. Its simple as this,a girl change the whole life of the boy. It's hard to give a negative comment about FFVIII. Maybe in junction system. Its confusing at the beginning but as the game move deeper, you will learn how to use it. And the graphics, its much cool than FFVII's pixels blocks. And the cut-scenes, it was portray really good. And the replay, many unanswered questions left in our mind. In short, this game really shook the whole world of RPGs...
