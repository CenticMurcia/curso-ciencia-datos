A*P*E is both stupid and follows the King Kong storyline, and is probably the worst movie I have ever seen.<br /><br />Everything from King Kong and even Godzilla is copied by A*P*E. 1 - The ape escapes from an oil tanker. 2 - Giant footprints are found. 3 - They want to show the Ape off to the public. 4 - Ape kidnaps girl. 5 - Girl feels somehow attracted to the Ape. 6 - Army attacks Ape.<br /><br />Besides having a duplicate plot, A*P*E has many technical problems as well.<br /><br />1 - The Ape is 36 feet tall, but the shark and snake are the size of him. 2 - He towers over buildings, but he's 36 feet tall. 3 - The Ape throws the snake at the camera, knocking it down. 4 - You can see the Ape actor's shirt underneath the costume. 5 - Tons of plastic toys in this film.<br /><br />And you can tell the actor who played the Ape is pretty angry over him playing the role. He flips off the camera at one point.<br /><br />A*P*E fails as a movie, but as a comedy, it's really good. Get a bunch of friends and do a MST3K kind of thing.
