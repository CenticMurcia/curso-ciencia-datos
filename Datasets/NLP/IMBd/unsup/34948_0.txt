This is an old-fashioned way how a film is made. The characters and the story are not what we can relate to. They are totally dull and unconvincing. Who cares about the pathetic jokes a guy putting himself in a difficult situation. Just painfully waited until it ended. This film is overrated and a big disappointment from Thailand.
