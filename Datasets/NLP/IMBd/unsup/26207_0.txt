This is one Europeon movie I have really enjoyed. Here you have a successful, yet pompous British author who goes to France to unwind, who however, gets to be roommates with the boss' daughter. Sarah Morton(Charlotte Rampling) is very successful, yet she is unhappy. Why's that? The stress? Maybe. The money? Could be. Being successful isn't always for everyone. Yet, one must accept what they have accomplished and must not delve into the darkness of success. So when Sarah goes to France, she stays a house that her boss owns, and later in the evening, his daughter comes in very unexpectedly. Julie(Ludivine Sagnier), is taking a break from work, and has a very high sexual appetite. Lots of sex, and intrigue which made the movie very interesting. And the murder of the waiter was disturbing as well. Covering up was easy, and the part where Sarah flashing the gardener, was a way she opened up. This movie was very intriguing, yet very disturbing at the same time. The title was great, and the swimming scenes lets out the sexual energy as well. A very interesting movie still! Ooh! La La! 5 stars!
