This time I'll start with the warnings. This movie is R-rated for a reason. I mean the title alone should give you a hint that this is a scary movie. in my opinion ghosts and monsters aren't scary because they're obviously not real. But the moment a movie show something terrifying that could be real, it's scary.Even though this is a more graphic film, the influences from Psycho and Night of the Living Dead are visible. I believe this movie qualifies as a slasher film.<br /><br />Another thing that makes this such a scary film is it's visuals. The movies low budget makes it looks eerily real. it has an almost documentary feel to it, and therefore are more believable. Also was was surprised to find that the skeleton ornaments in the film, was real. Apparently Tobe Hooper couldn't afford fake skeletons, but found an Indian company that sold real ones for a low price. This definitely freaked me out while watching it.<br /><br />Tobe Hooper definitely made film history with The Texas Chain Saw Massacre and he started a phenomenon. The Texas Chain Saw Massacre along with, Psycho, Night of the Living Dead, Jaws and Halloween made horror films what it is today. A genre that before had been frowned upon and never really explored, was taken to the next level with The Texas Chain Saw Massacre. And since horror has been a widely accepted genre.<br /><br />So any films have been inspired by The Texas Chain Saw Massacre, heck even a guy at my age who makes amateur movies made a scarily good and similar film to this. Another film which is like an urban version of this is; American Psycho, a film which I also recommend.<br /><br />This movie also set the standards for low-budget films a lot higher. the fact that this brilliant horror masterpiece came out of so little, is all thanks to Tobe Hooper. Many great director took inspiration from Hooper and made some really scary and cheap horror films. Take The Evil Dead (1981) 10 film students, $375,000 and still a great film. The budget for The Texas Chain Saw Massacre was only $140,000.<br /><br />I give this movie a 8/10.
