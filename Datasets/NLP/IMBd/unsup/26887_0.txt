We showed this at our local Art film movie-house. It is where it belongs.<br /><br />Watch it if you think that David Cronenberg's adaptation of Burrough's book, "Naked Lunch," is too linear. If you don't know who William Burroughs is definitely avoid this. This has more to do with surrealist dream films than documentaries. <br /><br />Delightfully mad IMHO.<br /><br />Bees, Bouroughs, Book of the Dead. Egyptian myth.<br /><br />Anti-War Sci-Fi Cyberpunk "My dead wife was in the hive. She fragmented." "They were the dead and vengeance was their life." "I was Cain." "The Planet of Television, transmitting the dead."<br /><br />It's all pretty schizophrenic. Jacob Maker, beekeeper, in the land of the dead and the garden of eden, Iraq.
