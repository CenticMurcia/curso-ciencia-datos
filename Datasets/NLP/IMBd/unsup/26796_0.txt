This is a very technically good film, with interesting casting and scripting, but it is far from the truth historically. Being from the Milwaukee Wisconsin area, I did some research into the history of this man, and found it very different from the Hollywood depiction.<br /><br />The Generals insubordination was more about his arrogance and ego than any caring about the future. He was a spoiled rich brat who always had things his way. The changes that came in aviation would have came without his infamous courtroom case. He was the exact opposite of the Gary Cooper portrayal, being short and angry in nature.<br /><br />He sacrificed his military career because he cared so much about the fliers? Questionable at best. This rich kid was tired of playing soldier, so went on a public opinion campaign, that was somewhat successful in giving him a role in the history of aviation.<br /><br />He was very effective at alienating everyone around him. There are numerous histories of this man, polarized either in the he was a visionary versus a pompous self righteous jerk, all making good reading.
