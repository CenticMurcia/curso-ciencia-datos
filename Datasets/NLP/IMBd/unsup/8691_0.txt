The TV movie version of Washington Irving's classic American story diverges from the book in many ways, however this is a great movie. Jeff Goldblum is great as Ichabod Crane, with his tall, skinny frame storking throughout the movie (although for some reason he's constantly licking his lips). Fritz VanderHoff, his patron and introduction to Sleepy Hollow's supernatural side, is amazing comic relief and really gets into the historic side of his handyman character. Paul Sand is also quite good as Fred Dutcher, Dick Butkus' sidekick. I grew up with this movie and still love it, from the period clothing and locations to the close ups of Palmer in the barn. Every time that I watch it I come away with something new. The picture quality is lacking, as it is a reproduction of a 1980 TV movie, so its just itching for a DVD release. This is truly an American classic and Jeff Goldblum; et.al. should be petitioning for it's re-release on television, if not a theatrical release.
