About the only accurate thing in the movie is the title. Yes, it does feature an F-117 Nighthawk. Well, sort of. Anything other than close-ups of the actors is either stock footage from other movies or government films. Virtually all of the F-117 is identical to what you'd see on a History Channel special (any of which, by the way, is more worthwhile to watch than this). One of the most laughable scenes is the one in which the Good-Guy-Hero-Extrodinaire flies virtually every variation of the F-16! First, he climbs into the cockpit of an F-15. As he takes off (without removing the wheel chocks, of course!) its your generic F-16. But...my God! By mid-flight, its been magically transformed into a two-seater F-16B trainer! But wait! Now the gray F-16 has altered its paint scheme to become a bluish tiger-stripped Red Flag adversarial training jet!<br /><br />So many other screw ups and laugh-out-louds that others pointed out, like the Presidential Motorcade consisting of his limo and one other sedan (whatever) as well as the "War Room" consisting of 9 chairs, a table, and a 20" Sony.<br /><br />As far as the actors go, Ice-T has moved on to bigger and better things, like Law & Order: SVU (an excellent franchise to be a part of).<br /><br />1/2 out of ***** for plot, storyline, accuracy, and everything else important in a movie.<br /><br />****1/2 out of ***** for camp value.
