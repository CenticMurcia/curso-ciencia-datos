Well this is fun. Admittedly you have to be in the mood for a cheesy, somewhat silly B-movie horror flick but if you're in the right frame of mind this will do the trick.<br /><br />Also, maybe it's better that you're somewhat fond of Dennis Miller, since he basically carries this vampire flick. He's never out of character and if you've seen him once on "The O'Reilly Factor"...that's in short what you'll get.<br /><br />The story here...well, Miller plays a P.I. who uncovers a brothel full of vampires. In the great "Tales from the Crypt" tradition, this is full of great gore, low-brow humor and and a twist ending to boot.<br /><br />The cast here is great, with lovely eye-candy's courtesy of Angie Everhart and Erika Eleniak, the slightly-better-half of the Corey's (that reminds me, I have to dig up "Licence to Drive" one of these days) and the sorely underrated Chris Sarandon hamming it up as a crazy preacher doin' the Lord's work in inventive ways.<br /><br />While not as successful as "Demon Knight", "Bordello of Blood" is a fun horror flick that packs in a good dose of silly humor and gore. What's not to like?
