I love this movie, and in re-watching it again I was impressed by Allison Forster's performance as Madeline. However, in looking on the internet, this appears to be her only work. Does anyone know what became of her? I would have hoped that someone that talented would have moved on, but I found nothing. This movie is a gem. I try to watch it once a year because it brings back long-forgotten memories of what it was like to ask for your first date, the awkwardness of the first kiss, and the whole new dimension of relating to the opposite sex. Thanks for any information you have on Allison, if only I had had a sister like that... davidjanmellinger@yahoo.com
