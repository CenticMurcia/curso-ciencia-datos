A slasher flick is a slasher flick, but when the dialog is terrible and the actors aren't much better, it becomes just another ho hum event; one that I am sure that Brad Pitt would like to forget.<br /><br />Pitt had his first credited movie roles in 1989. This was one of them, and the lesser of the two according to most fans. He plays a dumb jock that isn't even a good jock. Fortunately, he has his girlfriend (scream-queen Jill Schoelen) to save him from the slasher. Why do these girls hook up with the dumb jocks? Maybe because it's Brad Pitt! <br /><br />With Roddy McDowall, Martin Mull, and Ione Skye's brother (Donovan Leitch) as the slasher, it was fairly predictable; down to the lame attempt at humor with the cheerleader taking off her panties before the game.<br /><br />I am surprised that the American Legion or VFW hasn't protested the use of the American Flag in this movie. Maybe they figured no one saw it.<br /><br />I'm not sure if this was released first or Happy Together was. It could be Pitt's film debut. Anybody know?
