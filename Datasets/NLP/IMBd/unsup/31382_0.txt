This almost-psychedelic mix-version of Cinderella and The Sound of Music are funny and with a lot of references at the actual situation of life in Argentina (ALL the people, including The Rich and The Poor, Bads and Good Guys, are capable of any thing for a couple of Euros, including sleep on the floor and shine shoes). The music is surprising good, the actors are VERY good (Macedo is superb, the best, Stefani is THE WITCH, the boys they make its work rather well, the role of Agustín Sierra, Martín, is very funny, with his constant psychological auto-diagnoses, the psychiatrist is terrific, Lorenzo (Esteban Prol) is really good... and ... and Florencia Bertotti is an angel living in the Earth. I'm not indeed an adolescent, but definitively I have fall in love with this girl. The success of the two-year serial it has taken to continue history, in musical version, in the theaters until today.<br /><br />And if you like this, be patient, they are only almost 500 chapters.
