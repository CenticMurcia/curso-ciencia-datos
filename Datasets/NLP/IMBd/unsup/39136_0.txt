Eye of God is a well-crafted independent film that is fatally flawed by its reliance on a current mainstream-film cliche as a central plot element: that any character with religious convictions will be revealed in the course of the film as a psychopath. It demonstrates once more that most filmmakers today have no clue in depicting religious experience in either an authentic or a sympathetic fashion. A waste of talent.
