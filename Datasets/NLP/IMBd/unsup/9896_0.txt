Saw it before, and watched it again last night, even though I normally don't watch films twice. Period.<br /><br />I think this is a brilliant film.<br /><br />The humour in it is great, even though I knew what was coming. I mean: the fact that I remembered some of the lines from watching it a couple of years ago, while I can't remember what I had for dinner yesterday, speaks for itself. In my book anyway. :-)<br /><br />Regardless of the comments, by others or myself, this film deserves a chance, so if you've never seen it I heartily recommend watching it. I'm (pretty) sure you'll love it.
