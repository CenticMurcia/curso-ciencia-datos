My baby sister was watching this movie, because she wants to be a "baller" like me. So i sat with her, and i was watching the movie. And i liked it even more, because i had meet up with the same type of girls when i was in the basketball team, and i also got my ankle injured because of the same reason, trying so hard to be in the front, but thats what happens when you get that attitude. I love this movie, its not only for kids, i know for a fact teenagers will love it as much as i did. I think this movie is EXCELLENT! I give it a 13 out of 10! The actors were very good to. And the Ending was the best to me! I though thats was so COOL! I don't want to spoil the ending, you have to watch this movie!
