The bad reviews and accusations of cheesiness put me off watching this one for a little while, but I watched it last night and had a blast. I was surprised to see Danny Lee, who I recognised from a few Category Three films. He plays a nice anthropologist, and comes off as innately kinda cool throughout the movie. The plot is a lot like King Kong, but the Mighty Peking Man is a much less ferocious and more sympathetic and human character than Kong. Mighty Peking Man is a friendly giant ape man who cares for a jungle girl and takes a lot of abuse before he snaps. In contrast, the humans are mostly pretty scummy, apart from Danny Lee's character and the jungle girl. This makes the film more interesting and less black and white than the average monster film and causes the ending to be genuinely poignant. There is a lot about this film that is cheesy, especially in the first half. However the movie is directed with brilliant gusto and the music helps carry the fast moving events along nicely, with a range of musical themes fitting well to different scenes. There is a lot of action in the movie, and great destruction. The action is a lot more visceral than most disaster films, with lots of people being caught up and crushed in Mighty Peking Man's rampage, or other events in the earlier part of the film. I believe that the director was responsible for some of the Shaw studios demented horror, which could explain the how the film is very enjoyably destructive at times. There was certainly potential at times for the film to get fairly gruesome, though it remains a family affair. I thoroughly recommend this movie, it does look cheap and a bit silly at times, it is cheesy and unintentionally funny in parts too. However, its just such darn fine and memorable entertainment that these are barely issues.
