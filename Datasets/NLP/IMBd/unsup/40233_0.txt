This is one of the most infuriating films I have watched in a long, long while. It looks like some first-time scriptwriter couldn't get sufficient backing and then directed his script himself. No two scenes make sense when put together, the premise about the businessman getting paid $10,000 dollars each time he impregnates a lesbian is preposterous and embarrassingly realized here. It turns out that, committed lesbians or not, these gals just luuuuuuuuve our main man's sexual prowess and equipment, which is just about the most homophobic notion of any American film this whole decade.<br /><br />On top of Spike Lee's blatant homophobia and the not too bright racial stereotyping, on top of all that put the hypocrisy of two lesbians talking the ex-fianc√©e of one of them into making an easy buck with his sperm, and afterwards, having impregnated 19 women, he feels he must pay in hell and now HE'S sorry he got THEM into it.<br /><br />The whole thing is a mess and devoid of charm or intelligence. Anthony Mackie in the lead is a personable actor, not mention incredibly easy on the eyes, and I would love to see him in something worthwhile.<br /><br />But it is going to take some time, before this monstrosity of a film is forgotten.
