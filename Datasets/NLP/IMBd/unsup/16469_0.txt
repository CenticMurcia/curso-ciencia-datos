Joe Dante is one of my favourite directors and this is easily his best film. So many films claim to be magical but this is one of a few that genuinely is. It makes you feel good about the world and is one of the best films ever about the joys of childhood and the power of dreams. There are so many outstanding moments there isnt enough space to list them here. The direction, effects, acting, music and cinematography are all top of the line. Everyone goes on about how as soon as the kids get into space this completely falls apart, but sorry I disagree. I love the stuff with Wak and Neek and Dante favourite Picardo is great as usual. Like the kids themselves at first it seems strange and disappointing that the mysterious of the universe turn out to be a couple of TV junkies, but afterwards they/you realise what good time was had.<br /><br />This totally proves that the Yanks have very little taste (proved yet again by the success of Spider-Man) with this getting very poor reviews and virtually no box-office (I cant believe the amount of people who have said a film must be good because its made a load of money - two words - Pearl Harbor!), but when it finally got a limited release here in the UK it got very good reviews indeed.<br /><br />I was disappointed to read recently that Joe Dante, at a Sci-Fi Con, apologised for anyone having to endure this. Well up until now he has always defended it and said it was his most personal film, so shame on you Joe for caving in and I for one will quite happily endure this for many years to come.<br /><br />Ive only ever since this on grainy VHS, so please, please Paramount give us a widescreen DVD some time soon!
