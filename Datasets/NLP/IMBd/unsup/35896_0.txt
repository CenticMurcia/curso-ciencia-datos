It may just have been a cheep act to make money off of the success of "The Lion King" but it was pretty cool for what it was. What was great about it was how it was everything the movie was not: goofy, silly, bizarre, slapstick style. A lot of it is clich√© and boring, but some is very funny and wildly entertaining. Also, some of the animation and painting in the series is beautiful and colorful. Plus, it was fun to see all of my favorite characters,including the Hyenas, Simba and Rafiki. It may be just a cheesy novelty and it might not have been as good as "The Odd Couple", but it was certainly worth taping onto my TeVo.
