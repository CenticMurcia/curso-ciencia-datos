This will sure make fans of grotesque children's shows like X-Men happy but it is guaranteed to be a source of disappointment if not anger to viewers familiar with the atmosphere present in Jin Yong's writing. The film's basic handicap is its effort to shrink a lengthy epic (at least partially) to a standard theatrical run. In the course of the film, you can never know what genre it strives to be in. A regular MA film, period drama or straight slapstick comedy? Sexual jokes and especially the absurd depiction of Huashan (Wah San) cult members serve nothing but to dilute the effect of the setting. The character played by Sammo Hung would fit to any grey-haired, eccentric kung fu master but when it poses to be the portrayal of a mythical Chinese sage like Zhang Sanfeng (Chang San-fung), it becomes too light even to be taken seriously. Few reasons to see this one may be the distinguished acting of Jet Li and mesmerising beauty of Sharla Cheung. In a film with a little from everything, it is doubtful that you'll find anything. Wong Jing would have done better if he kept in waters he knows well. I'd prefer a "Naked Killer" Chingmy Yau for sure.
