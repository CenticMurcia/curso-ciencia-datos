One star is being generous.<br /><br />I can't even express in words how bad this movie was. There is no sense to the plot what-so-ever. Why is her father kept alive? What are those "energy balls" Gen show her? How does she learn to perform such things? Why did I spend 90 minutes watching this terrible film?<br /><br />This is a RIP OFF. They used the title "street fighter" to attract fans, in order to make money. I really hope the production & publishing cost more than the lame &12 mil it earned (12?? really???).<br /><br />The worst part of the movie, is the hot detective / "cool" interpool guy plot. Seriously, what are they doing? What are they donating to the movie? Nothing.<br /><br />Seriously, don't watch this movie. You're better off watching youtube - whatever you'll see there is better than this movie.<br /><br />And I'm not joking.
