This movie is a great example of a movie that was done so well that it holds up even after over 50 years. I only became aware of it when I checked into imdb to see the reviews for the recent remake and was directed to check out the original which was at the library. This movie captured the essence of the fight world, the acting was great and the ending suspenseful
