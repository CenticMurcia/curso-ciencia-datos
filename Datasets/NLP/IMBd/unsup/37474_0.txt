Two of us couples decided to go see a movie on a Saturday night. One of the ladies had gone to art school in New York and thought she would enjoy the film. Since it was Mother's Day we all decided to go see this film. Since she is the artist in our group, we thought she would enjoy it. To sum it up, after about 20 minutes, she kept lighting up her watch to see what time it was. We stayed to the end of the film (which seemed an eternity) but just when you think it can't get any worse, it does. It didn't seem to understand where it was going and spun entirely out of control the last half of the film. I wouldn't recommend this film to my worse enemy. As an added note, somebody should buy our "star" a pair of tweezers! LOL
