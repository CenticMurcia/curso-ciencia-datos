Oh, wow, this is simply amazing cinema...Energetic...Playful...Rousing...Engaging...There are not enough superlatives to throw at Corbucci's masterwork. I like it a little more than "The Great Silence" because of its eccentric style and storyline. It is never less than enthralling and manages to be extremely moving.<br /><br />Morricone's score? Just brilliant. What a genius he is! May he live to compose forever... and always assisted by the great Bruno Nicolai, an accomplished composer in his own right.<br /><br />Franco Nero is wonderful, as always, as The Swede, Jack Palance is charisma-plus as John, Tomas Milian is rough-edged and likable despite his total lack of morals as El Vasco. Too many great thespian turns to single out, but you get the point.<br /><br />Terrific location work, stupendously good shoot-outs, stunts, explosions, poetic action... all lathered in baked, painfully evocative cinematography.<br /><br />And that final image to red freeze frame...Bella! Corbucci was as worthy a Western director as Leone, but he never got the same recognition. One day he will.
