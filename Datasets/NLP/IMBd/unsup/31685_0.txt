We saw it opening night and were blown away. I don't do spoilers so let me tell you about reactions. My girls are 8 and 12 and they were positively glued to the screen. I thought it a wonderful story and a great production too. The girls made me promise to buy the DVD when it comes out and we went straight to the book store to get the stories of Nurse Matilda that the movie was based on. Now, here is where the academy award comes in. I don't have the categories memorized but the team that was able to make such a wonderful screenplay out of such a lousy book surely deserves that award. It is rare when it happens but yes, the movie was a FAR sight better than the book. If you have kids or if you need to entertain your inner kid, go see this movie.
