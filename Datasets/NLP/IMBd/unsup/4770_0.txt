I loved the low key, surreal mood present throughout this movie! Heather (Agnes Bruckner) is required to go to a boarding-school during the 1960's era, by her very proper and upscale mom (Emma Campbell). This is to help reform her after a fire-starting incident involving Heather and an evidently irksome forest close to home. The very proper instructors at this school, behave very mysteriously (they must know something:). <br /><br />The head mistress who is named Miss. Traverse (Patricia Clarkson), both takes an interest in Heather and seems to know something of her powers. Heather tries to do her time, but then the strange stuff starts happening - one student disappears, another has an accident. <br /><br />Heather eventually realizes that she has a supernatural power and that destiny has led her here - because these woods really do need a good burning!! The ending is both exciting and re-uniting.
