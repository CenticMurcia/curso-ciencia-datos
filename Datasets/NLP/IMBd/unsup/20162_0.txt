I liked this movie not only for what it said, but how it said it. It was inspiring--not in its religiosity but in its morality. The Christian slant of the movie was evident, but it did not proselytize or become judgmental. In fact, some of the 'best' people in the film never reveal any religious beliefs. I am a Unitarian-Universalist (we believe that there are many paths that lead to good and moral actions), so I appreciated the MORAL outlook of the film and its emphasis on good works.That is a fine line to draw and this movie does it magnificently.<br /><br />Are there plot holes? Inconstistancies? Who cares? The movie made me feel good. And sometimes that's enough.
