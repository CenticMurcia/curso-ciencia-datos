Irwin Allen should be thanked for discovering a cure for insomnia.<br /><br />The most notable feature about this movie is in the credits. Gayle Kananiokalapontigay's name takes two lines.<br /><br />The movie is another Irwin Allen disaster - all the way around.<br /><br />What agents got Paul Newman, William Holden, Jacqueline Bisset, Red Buttons, Ernest Borgnine, Burgess Meredith, James Franciscus, Barbera Carrera, Veronica Hamel, Edward Albert and Pat Morita into this loser?<br /><br />And the writing? What writing? Carl Foreman and Stirling Silliphant should have had their names removed to save some embarrassment.<br /><br />A bag of fish left in a car trunk in Sylmar would smell better than this stinker.<br /><br />The story is stupid. A volcano settles scores and rights wrongs. Except it didn't destroy the master print copy. The acting is wooden, with bad, cliche lines just being spoken. And there's not one shred of excitement or danger at the climax. Just 20 minutes of watching 10 boring people cross a footbridge over a lava bed that poses no real harm.<br /><br />Somehow Allen got this financed, and nobody read the script. At least I hope that's what happened. Otherwise some people would do anything, and I mean anything, for money.<br /><br />When Time Ran Out, everybody fled the set.<br /><br />Even if you've got five million hours left to live, don't waste one second on this piece of junk. Unless you're an insomniac. Even then, you will sleep, but your stomach's gonna churn with this garbage in it.
