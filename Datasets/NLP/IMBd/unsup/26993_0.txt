This is just the best reality show that there has ever been. Every show they put in a bunch of people and we watch them 24-7. They have to also perform tasks to get their rewards, e.g. shopping, food, booze, fags, etc. It is basically like a pantomime, if you are the biggest character in the house it is more likely that you would win the show and Â£100,000, and you are booed or cheered. All the other house mates get evicted, it's us that decides who stays and who goes. Recently Big Brother turned evil and produced the best of the series so far in BB5. That is when I started to like it, since BB5 it has still been a great show. BB5 had the courageous winner Nadia, the nudity of Shell and Michelle, the camp Marco, and my favourite Victor, the slick man. BB6 had some okay people including Science, Roberto, Derek, Makosi, Eugene and winner Anthony. BB7 had some fantastic people including Grace, Lea, Nikki, Aisleyne Glyn and winner Pete. I would have loved to have seen Craig Phillips, Nasty Nick Bateman, Brian Dowling, Jade Goody (who returned in Celebrity Big Brother 2007 with Mum Jackiey and boyfriend Jack), Kate Lawler, Alex Sibley and Jon Tickle. Hosted by Davina McCall and Dermot O'Leary, and narrated by Marcus Bentley. Davina McCall was number 95 and Jade Goody number 4 on The 100 Worst Britons, and it has been on all 100 Greatest TV Treats programmes so far. Outstanding!
