This is not a "bad movie" at all. I never watched the movies at all until like a week ago and i thought the movie was VERY good!!! It was one of the best movies I've seen. I thought it was also a very good plot. Marnie Cromwell had to save her family before it was too late and she did. It's not a remake it's a sequel. It was a very good continuation of what I can understand, even though I've never seen the first one and this was my first time watching the second one. i thought it was weird how when marnie met Luke and didn't know he was really evil so he stole aggie's spell book and used it against them. So the movie was excellent and i would recommend it to anyone and everyone!
