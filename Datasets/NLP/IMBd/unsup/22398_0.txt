This show is quite possibly the pits of hell for me. It follows spoilt, filthy rich, snobby and bratty 15 year old kids plan and execute their 'sweet 16' birthday party.<br /><br />Im physically sickened by the way some of these kids treat their parents. They have no respect, no manners and are genuinely awful people, they symbolise everything that is wrong with the world. Clearly the parents need to beat the crap out of these kids to knock some sense into them, i would if they were mine.<br /><br />It is awful programming, for the simple minded. People who enjoy this show must not have an education and they have to be the dumbest, thickest people on the planet. MTV today has brought some crap onto our screens like 'laguna beach,' 'the hills' and many others, but i think this is the icing on the cake...
