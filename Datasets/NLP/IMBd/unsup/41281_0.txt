What more can I say about Contagion that hasn't been already said in other remarks? This movie makes Ghostbusters & Space Balls a work of art! Megan Gallagher is the only actor/actress in this movie that's actually believable even though Debbie Ann Thomas (Nurse Washington) was extremely good for the little she acted. Give me more Debbie Ann Thomas and less Bruce Boxleightner and this movie may actually be 5 stars. Bruce, just promise me that you'll never be acting president ever again because you reminded me a lot of Bill Clinton. The flow of the movie was actually decent though. Everything went according to plans and you could actually keep track of going on besides having mind bending confusions everywhere throughout the movie. This movie is unbelievable though. Nothing in this movie can truly happen unless pigs started flying from the sky and money grew on trees. The end of this movie was probably the worst I have ever seen in my 18 years of watching movies. It was so predictable within the first 5 minutes of the movie what was going to happen. Sometimes, the camera shots didn't flow with the other ones with different lenses. Overall, this is pretty much garbage. If the actors careers weren't over before this movie, they should be pretty much done now. If you want to watch a good movie, get Scarface, Godfather, or Anchorman, but if you want to get a good laugh from what's supposed to be a serious movie, then i suggest you give this a look.<br /><br />Anthony Inangelo
