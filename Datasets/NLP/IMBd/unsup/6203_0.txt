First off, I am a bloke in my 20's so probably not the target age range, but forget that. This was an absolutely phenomenal film. I saw this back to back with Pirates of the Caribbean & there is no comparisons- this is streets ahead. <br /><br />I was even pleasantly surprised with how much female flesh you got to see given it was a '12'. And pleasantly surprised too how good some of the women still looked, infact better than some of the Hollywood's younger women that attempt to pass themselves off as actresses.<br /><br />Everything you want is here, hilarious humour, great storyline, happiness, sadness the lot. The 6.7 rating is ridiculous, but that is with little over 100 voters. Everyone I know likes it, it was the first film I've seen since Notting Hill where you could sense the entire cinema were enjoying it (and people of all ages, colours, shapes and the like) and with a few more votes it should get some better marks & reviews.<br /><br />I'd imagine the people who didn't laugh at this are the same mob who didn't laugh at any of the Full Monty or Four Weddings. Obviously the subtle dry wit is too complex & they prefer the sort of humour from we get from our friends across the pond, either with 3 blokes & 3 girls all living in the same penthouse apartment despite being unemployed & all in their 40's or failing that, jokes about penises in apple pies or people being sick in a frying pan then eating it.<br /><br />Given the storyline it was never going to be a 10/10 film but it's a low 9/10.<br /><br />Mark
