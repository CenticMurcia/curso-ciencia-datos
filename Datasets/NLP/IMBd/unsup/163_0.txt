This movie in not just another sentimental movie.<br /><br />It's a movie about heroism at a personal level. It's about great motives like the defense of freedom and the importance of personal choice in times where values have to be defended, even with your life. It's about personal decisions and living after with the consequences.<br /><br />Great acting by that giant actor/director, Mr. Orson Wells and a very moving performance by Claudette Colbert, in a very difficult role.<br /><br />This film has all the elements of a good psychological thriller: someone coming back from the dead, a past that comes to haunt you after 20 years, exile in your own land, fighting the Nazis, and finally, leaving the past behind to join the living in the present.<br /><br />A great 1946 movie by Irving Pichel. Don't miss it if you see it late at night in the TV. You will be surprised by it's quality.<br /><br />As a bonus, the third performance in film, by the then 8 year old Natalie Wood, as an adorable little blond Austrian exile girl.
