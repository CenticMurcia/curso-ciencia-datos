"<br /><br />This movie is nothing but a David Whateverhisnameis vanity project (written/acted/directed by...), and it shows in every interminable scene of this over-long and dull STV miscarriage. The film has the air and atmosphere of a swaddled cot-death baby and I fear that is due more to neglect than over-nurturing.<br /><br />The opening scene is kind of promising, and sets a vaguely supernatural feeling air, but drops such allusions immediately thereafter and turns into a plodding pedestrian made-for-TV pseudo-thriller.<br /><br />There is no suspense, no gore, no shocks, no horror, no surprises and nothing remotely inspiring to be seen. The film just drags and drags on and it feels much longer than it's 84min run-time.<br /><br />The main "trick" of the movie will soon make you so sick of it you will wish never ever to see any "the killer" pass quickly across in front of camera ever again. Yes. That "trick". Already bored of it, well too bad, because it's done to death in Little Erin Merryweather. There she goes flashing across in the background...oh, there she goes flashing past in the foreground...yeah.<br /><br />The script is a try-hard affair, but unfortunately the writer should have tried a lot harder, as it comes across very clumsily in delivery. The acting is jarring at best, and jaw-droppingly appalling in some scenes, lending an even greater air of implausibility to an already shaky script.<br /><br />****SPOILERS FOLLOW******<br /><br />Add into the mix such criminal plot-holes as her mysteriously being able to vanish at the end, while the person who shot her must clearly be looking directly at her, and I'm sorry but the movie becomes even more of a shambolic hack-job.<br /><br />Worst movie I've seen in a long long time, so don't be drawn in by the nice box art like I was.
