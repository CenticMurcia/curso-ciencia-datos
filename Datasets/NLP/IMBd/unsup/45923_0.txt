All in all, "Who Saw Her Die?" is a very well-done giallo, but those of us who have seen more than a few of these kind of films can pretty much see the ending from five miles away. I don't want to rag on it too much; the soundtrack is fairly decent, the acting is okay, the story makes sense and the script is well-penned. It just fails to shock us or to make us think.<br /><br />A psychopath randomly offs a young, red-haired girl in the 60's. Fast forward to the 70's, it happens again. The murders are tied together. The neglecting, mournful father tries to find the killer and is successful in the end. Not much else really happens. It turns out to be a typical Hitchcockesque twist that will have you nodding your head, saying to yourself 'gee I didn't see that coming...' I'd recommend at least a dozen giallos before this one. Check out "The House With Laughing Windows" for a magnificent example of the genre.<br /><br />4 out of 10, kids.
