This film was broadcast in it's entirety in 1988. I taped it off TV and still have the VHS copy. Not nearly as good as the 1985 theatrical movie. Remo character is a weak and whiny pretty-boy. Chiun is so-so; not a believable master of Sinanju. Title music is from the 1985 movie, which is the only really good thing about this attempt. Not a bad script, and might have been great with Fred Ward and Joel Grey, but this version "walks like a pregnant yak". Has "made for TV" written all over it. Boring, which is inexcusable for an action film. If you liked the 1985 movie beware of this pale sequel. How about a theatrical remake???
