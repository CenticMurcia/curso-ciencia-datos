Here's the scenario: You walk into the local video store and you see the B-Horror section. You think to yourself, "Maybe I'll get a bad horror film tonight and enjoy some pathetic film making." You walk down the isles of movies and one catches your eye. A movie known as Hellbreeder. You think to yourself, "This looks interesting." Well trust me you couldn't be more wrong. This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I can say this because I have seen the worst of the worst B-Horror films, from Ed Wood's Plan 9 From Outer Space, to the early 80's Scalps. The plot will remind you of Stephen King's IT; a scary clown that kills little kids. This plot is good for the basis of a horror film, yes. But what it lacks is any kind of acting, dialog, camera stability, good special effects, and really there is no way to tell what is happening. There are actually scenes in this movie that made me very sick because of the camera movements. I really do not know what else to say to express my disgust in this movie. So I'll put it really simply.<br /><br />DO NOT!!! - AND I REPEAT - DO NOT PURCHASE THIS MOVIE!!! Anyone who tells you otherwise should be committed.
