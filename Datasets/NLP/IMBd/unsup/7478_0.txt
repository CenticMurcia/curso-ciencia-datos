I wasn't expecting much, but this movie actually delivered the goods! In this day and age of "torture porn", it was nice to be able to watch a horror movie that actually had suspense, mystery, and and a plot line. Gorehounds, this movie is not for you. But if you enjoy horror mixed with mystery, suspense, and heartbreaking drama, this movie is for you.<br /><br />Pros: Nora Zehetner, "Eden" from "Heroes" really shines in this movie. The rest of the cast is fine, particularly Jessica Amlee as "Amy" and Gabrielle Rose as the mean "Mrs. Locke". This movie has a mystery - not a body count. The score is haunting. The make-up effects are incredible.<br /><br />Cons: The movie could have benefited from better cinematography. You rarely see horror movies shot so brightly nowadays. The camera captures everything you need to see, but it is done in an almost matter-of-fact manner with no flair.
