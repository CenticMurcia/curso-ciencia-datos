There is absolutely no salvation for this abomination of comedic film. It's not even so stupid it's funny, its just really stupid. Thomas Lennon (Lt. Dangle from Reno 911) is just about the only character with any humor. The blind guy has no funny parts either, you basically have to force yourself to laugh. The main character is as drab as he is two-dimensional. This was an opportunity to be a good film, but it just doesn't even come close. Christopher Walken has once again embarrassed himself, not for being bad, for continually appearing in third rate films. He has never turned down a movie offer, and I respect that, but could he just stop doing things like this?? There are only two positives in this movie, Maggie Q is hot, and Thomas Lennon's performance, other than that, it's basically worse than Gigli.
