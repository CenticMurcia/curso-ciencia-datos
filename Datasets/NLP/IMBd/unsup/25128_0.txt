How wonderful, how divine, how engrossing..........it's the Grand Hotel where "nothing ever happens", according to Lewis Stone's character. This is one of those films that must be watched repeatedly to savor the glamour and nuances of the performances of the star-studded cast. Let's talk about the cast. GARBO: Many think she went over-the-top with her performance of the ballerina who doubts her own talent and star power. Instead I find it exactly right. She is playing an artist given to flights of fancy and eccentricity (she'd be called a diva today). Watch her as she plays her scenes with John Barrymore......she is besotted with him after their night together. It's perfect JOHN BARRYMORE: The troubled star gives it his all as the suave, desperate but basically decent Baron. He hits just the right note in his performance and it was to be his next to last great performance. JOAN CRAWFORD: "WOW" might be the word for her playing of the slightly dishonorable stenographer. I think this may be one of her greatest roles before she went on the likes of "Mildred Pierce" and her other roles of suffering women. LIONEL BARRYMORE: His character (but not his acting) is the one I like least because he is constantly cringing and apologizing; however,based on the type of role it is, he is right on the money. His scenes with his brother are extremely well done. WALLACE BEERY: Nobody could have done the blustering, egocentric magnate better than Beery. He spent a lot of his career in more comedic roles and here he shows that he can actually act.<br /><br />Lewia Stone, as the disfigured doctor who is always waiting for a message (what kind of message is never made clear) is good in support as is Jean Hersholt, the head porter.<br /><br />Yes, it's dated, maybe some of the dialogue is considered corny, and the performances are of the time..........and it is magnificent. Check into the Grand Hotel. You won't want to check out.
