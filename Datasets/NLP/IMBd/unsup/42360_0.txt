Wow, this movie wasn't great, I'm a huge fan of Paul Gross, and I must say, it looks like he tried, but there wasn't much point in wasting energy, however, if you enjoy laughing at movies that have completely missed the mark, (and seeing some excellent shots of Paul Gross)then this movie is good, however, if you are looking for an excellent adaptation of the book, I strongly recommend looking elsewhere. Although the movie is laughable at best, there are some very pretty ocean scenery shots, however, the shots are a bit close up for window views which is what they seem to be used as a lot. So it's definitely not the greatest movie out there, and the actors probably leave that one off their resume, but if you want to have a bit of fun laughing at it, it's good for that, but I wouldn't spend a lot of money on it.
