Inuyasha is basically the perfect anime show. It's not intended for children, since Inuyasha likes to curse a lot, and there tends to be some brief nudity occasionally. But other than that, this show has something for everyone! It is a romance, a comedy, a fantasy, action, adventure, a drama, and even an occasional scare from the demons they have to fight.<br /><br />The story itself is fantastic, and each character has their own wonderful personality. You find yourself loving each one. Especially Kagome and Inuyasha. You're always wondering what their next fight will be about. Every episode is terrific, you're always drawn into the story, and you're always left wondering what happens next. Watch it once, and you're hooked!
