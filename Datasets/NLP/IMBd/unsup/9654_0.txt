Oh my god, how bizarre was this movie! We saw this at one of the screenings in New York and I'll never forget it, because I hate horror movies and my boyfriend knows this. Later that night he terrorized me jumping out at me in the house with a red blanket over his head threatening to put rocks in my stomach. Needless to say, he's a freak and this movie was right up his alley.<br /><br />This movie really creeped me out. I loved that the "men" were the stupid vicitms for once. Speaking of that, there were some very cute boys in this movie. And then there's the doll. I hate dolls to begin with. This one is the mother of them all- it has no eyes.<br /><br />Seriously though, this is a great film... great music, actors, scenery yadda yadda... It definitely builds because when it gets to the point where there's only the one boy left, and he's hiding from her in the library, I was literally hiding under my seat. Even if you're not a horror freak like my boyfriend, you should still check it out because it is different and very creative.
