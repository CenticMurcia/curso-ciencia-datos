As an EMT/Firefighter and an embracer of public safety - of course I'm going to love this movie because it involves my favorite things. A firefighter, a cop, father & son - a little realm of the outer edge with suspense building throughout - how could it not be a hit? This movie kept me on the edge of my seat and requires you to pay attention to the details so you can grasp the concept. Once your in their world, it's an amazing trip that kept me guessing all the way to the end. It is my all time favorite movie! And I recommend it to everyone!
