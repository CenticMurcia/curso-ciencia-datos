For a low budget horror, this movie rocks... up until the last half hour which comprises itself of the exorcism chapter of the film, which everything is in essence, building up to. We know it's coming, we expect it to blow your socks off, but it just doesn't.<br /><br />You've got all the staple food of a spine chilling low budget horror.<br /><br />Simple effects used correctly really make your budget work for you. Dario Argento would be proud. The growl when Gail turns her head is a sweet sound byte, I think I'll use that for my "You've Got Mail" wav for GMail.<br /><br />When Gail looks in the mirror, walks away and her reflection stays there smiling at her I thought, hell yeah that's a cool gimmick.<br /><br />Gratuitous nudity is something directors are so afraid of these days, but with a straight to video release one doesn't have to worry so much about ratings, and like the MC from Cabaret would exclaim, these girls are hot, hot, hot! But, that's not enough to make a film other than a porn so we have to put that aside, and get scrutinizing, it has to be done, or as a movie reviewer I simply am not doing a very good job.<br /><br />I'm fairly certain there is no such ritual as the Rite of Abraham in this capacity as the Rite of Abraham actually refers to the act of circumcision. (SEPHER YEZIRAH Chaper 1:2) The place this movie fails in my opinion is two-fold.<br /><br />The blind priest doesn't look the part. He lacked the depth demanded by the part. He looks too young, and the intensity is simply not there. Also the demon is in a word; unimpressive.<br /><br />I cringed when they blatantly ripped off The Exorcist and Stigmata and actually laughed during the exorcism. The finale which consisted of the exorcism, or last half hour were just terrible.<br /><br />It's like the movie was hopeful for the first half but culminated in a complete meltdown at the end.<br /><br />Really it started out as a decent 6, but melted down into a 2... 3 since I'm feeling generous.
