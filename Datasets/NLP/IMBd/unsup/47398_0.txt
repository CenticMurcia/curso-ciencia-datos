Okay, so I've read all of the reviews on this movie. Let me break it down for you. I rented this movie already having a general idea what it was about. Even though I don't care for movies about infidelity, I wanted to see this particular one anyways. Ming-Na Wen is by far my absolute favorite actor, and I have always enjoyed watching Wesley Snipes' action movies.<br /><br />I've read the reviews and have concluded that this movie is getting far too much credit for it's "artsy" side. Yes, I agree with another reviewer that the movie is better once you watch the director's commentary version, but that doesn't replace the fact that I watched the entire movie with my stomach in knots. And don't get it twisted, it IS about infidelity. <br /><br />As the title suggests, there's a one night stand. Okay, I was expecting that. But the events that follow just drag the viewer down. Robert Downey Jr. played a decent role, but nothing extraordinary as others might have you believe. The entire movie is depressing, and the last ten minutes or so of the movie all the way up to the ending is just terrible! I'm not going to spoil anything, but let me just say that I hated it. The two scenes towards the end sealed my negative vote on this movie.<br /><br />I hate to write this, too. As I said, my favorite actor is in the movie, and I really enjoy most of the roles the other main actors have played in other films. But this flick dragged me down, and I wanted to eat a bullet by the end of the movie. Keep in mind, that the director (Michael Figgis) has a thing for infidelity (Does "Internal Affairs" ring any bells?), so just go into it knowing that.<br /><br />I'm sad to say it, but "One Night Stand" was a downer, despite all of the great actors and acting. Honestly, I would not recommend it. If you enjoy being cheated on and watching it happen to other people as well, then you'll probably love this movie. Knock yourself out.
