Mike Myers stars in his best movie ever, So I married an axe murderer. I really wish I had this movie on DVD. Mike Myers has done some great movies, but none have ever lived up to So I married an axe murderer. This is a Mike Myers comedy that doesn't have all that many fart jokes. Not much obvious humor. This is a Mike Myers comedy I would like to see more of in the future.<br /><br />The movie is about a guy named Charlie(Mike Myers). One day he meets a butcher named Harriet(Nancy Travis) and they eventually get married. But while they are dating he has suspicions about her. All of her past lovers have been murdered. <br /><br />This movie is so good for many reason. I really wish Mike Myers can go back to doing comedies like this because after seeing The Love Guru, I lost all hope in Mike Myers. But I saw this movie for the first time in years recently, and I thought"These were the days when Mike Myers actually did good stuff".<br /><br />So I married an axe murderer:****/****
