Excellent Movie! Cheech is sent to a factory full of illegal immigrants to pick up his cousin "Javier". When he gets there, a pile of cops come in a arrest the immigrants. They think cheech is one of them, and they send him to mexico. If he had only took his wallet with him, he wouldn't have been sent down south. I read all the reviews and most people didn't like this film, but i think it's the greatest thing since sliced bread! The best part of the movie is when he tells the prison guard, Phil,says "Rudy, you still owe me $100!" Cheech says "Yeah, Heres one of them, F**K YOU!" (I wish IMDb allowed curse words!) This gets a 7/10. It's worth your money!
