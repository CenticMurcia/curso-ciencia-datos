originally, i had high hopes for this movie. obviously, it IS madhuri dixit, who wudn't want to see her? and welll... it was a fantastic movie, as i expected. the songs were very well done and the dancing was .. spectacular. I'm not such a great fan of Hindi movies mainly because their story lines are so repetitive and speak of love, which is great, but this movie IS a hit for sure. dixit has come back with great style... one wud expect otherwise because of the years spent abroad and the difference in culture, also influencing a person over time. she apparently is still Indian, and I'm glad :) i'd give this movie a ten out of ten, because the acting is great and also the dance.. I'm intrigued by their dancing and can't wait till i get to see more of her future up-comings. this movie is so so good, that i just HAD to comment and make a login account on IMDb. it's THAT great. if ur a fan of dancing and madhuri, you should watch it. :)
