"Praise" is definitely not a promotion for Brisbane, as it's a very contemporary "Days of Wine and Roses" where booze is only part of the couple's addictions and power plays in a weird but very compelling very, very, very frank co-dependency relationship. <br /><br />Be prepared for a lot of nudity of a body covered in eczema rashes.<br /><br />The script is by the author of the book it's based on, so I guess he meant for the ending to just trail off where about the only thing the main character achieves is a hair cut. And boy did I keep wanting to tell him to clean up that room!<br /><br />The only other people in the audience were a noisy couple in front of me who came to see it for its Scrabble sub-text and when bored otherwise kept stretching their arms up right in front of my face.<br /><br />(originally written 7/6/2000)
