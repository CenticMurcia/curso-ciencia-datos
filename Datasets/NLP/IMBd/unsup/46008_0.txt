The fact that they make a reference to the movie 'Airplane' (one of the best spoof movies ever) is mockery. Avoid this movie.<br /><br />Plot: A serial murder tries to kill some local small town teens before they ruin any respect we may still have for comedy. Then Tom Arnold happens.<br /><br />Avoid this movie, the title has twice the amount of humor that the entire film has. The best part was the ending credits, I doubt many people have gotten that far. Avoid this movie, I was filled with more joy the dya I was diagnosed with cancer.<br /><br />Bottom Line: Tom Arnold came from under a stone in some remote swamp and continues to plague our media systems. He should be boycotted or thrown in jail for his attempts at acting, especially acting funny.
