I saw this movie and then I read the Popular Mechanic's debunking. I also watched the debates on TV featuring the producers of Loose Change and various skeptics.<br /><br />Without going into how emotionally charged these young men are (which is a funny thing for me to say because I'm only 25 myself), I was constantly annoyed by how they liked to repeat 'it just doesn't add up'.<br /><br />In my opinion, conspiracy theorist start off with an advantage, because while the adherents to the official version of events must PROVE their claims, the conspiracy theorists don't - they succeed when they manage to create enough doubt about the official version of events.<br /><br />I agree that there are some questionable areas in the official version of events.<br /><br />However, the alternative simply does not add up.<br /><br />Here are the reasons why the conspiracy theory (that the US government planned and carried out 9/11) does not add up.<br /><br />1. Why would the US government blow up the third building ('building 7') with bombs, hours after the attack? Why would they do this on purpose? Wouldn't doing so raise questions in everyone's minds??? <br /><br />2.Why would the US government fire a cruise missile into the Pentagon, and then say it was attacked by a passenger plane? Why would they risk being found out? Why not use a real plane (passenger plane or otherwise) and drive it into the pentagon, so that there is no danger of people raising questions about the lack of identifiable remnants of the plane at the crash site? <br /><br />3. Why would the US government crash 2 passenger planes into the WTC, and also blow up the buildings with bombs planted at various floors? Why risk being found out? Why not just blow up the WTC with bombs in the first place (with no planes crashing into them), and then claim it was a terrorist attack (of which they have proof)??? <br /><br />4. The official version claims that the planes were hijacked by terrorists, and that they crashed them into the WTC. But if the conspiracy theorists are correct, then who flew those planes into the WTC? Religious extremists are well known to strap bombs to their chests for suicide bombing, but are we to believe that somebody was prepared to die for the economic benefits of the USA??? If they were driven by an autopilot (as some people claim), then how can you explain the frantic phone calls of the passengers to their families??? <br /><br />They say truth is stranger than fiction. Sure it is strange that the 'building 7' collapsed, but just because you do not fully understand something, it doesn't mean it cannot happen.<br /><br />In summary, I think that the theories put forward by Loose Change have at least 10x the number of inconsistencies that the official version has.<br /><br />Now you'll probably claim that I am really a CIA agent who is typing this from some unknown location, under direction from some unknown branch of government.<br /><br />OOOOOOOOOOHHHHHH... creepy.........
