Just awful....... It doesn't make any sense at all...... It is not a comedy, not a thriller, not a caper movie... It is just nothing.... Why on earth do they make such stupid, inane movies??? I haven't any good or say, better, movies the two leads act in.. It is high time that ms Ryan cuts her hair, brush it and give it a good wash... She looks awful! Senor Banderas! Time to pack up and go back to Spain.. perhaps Pedro Almadovar will help you to rescue what's left of your once promising career.... I am glad I haven't paid any cent for this sordid affair... I wonder whether it has made any cent at all???? It puzzles me to read the few favorable lines on this film... I can not find one good thing in it... Just awful.....
