Who says you can't beat a dead horse several times over. Watch any slasher movie and you'll see what I mean. How much more gross can you get. Saw,Hostel,Hills Have Eyes,Freddy VS Jason etc, just to name a few.It's all about how many different disgusting,stomach churning ,vile ways you can kill a human being. Cutting off this,chopping off that,cannibalism, guts being ripped out, people being cut in half,eyes cut off or gouged out. The Texas Chainsaw Massacre the Beginning is another tired old retread of the same guy running around with a chainsaw hacking people up. No plot , just get a bunch of kids to run around and find different ways to hack them up. I like Lee Ermey but can't understand why he would do this garbage. He makes for a hot cop but thats about it. Only draw might be to see some hot chicks before they get offed. Otherwise bottom feeder material.
