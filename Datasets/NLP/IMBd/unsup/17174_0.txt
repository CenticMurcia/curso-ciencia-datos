This is yet another rapper's feeble attempt at creating a semi "autobiographical" film about being a hardened drug dealer who does whatever he wants and gets away with it. The lack of novelty and terrible acting would be forgivable if Cam'ron would have decided what he wanted this movie to argue and edited it appropriately. The entire film seemed as though it was made up as he went along, and was pretty much a dull mishmash of gangster movie conventions and clichés. After mucking about for the first hour, confusing all but those who either have an obsessive love of Cam'ron or this film genre, you find out he has a girlfriend (he didn't really have a love interest for the first half of the film) so he drops his pants and does the "look at my ass while I pretend to have sex" love scene that was reminiscent of DMX's scene in "Belly". In fact, this whole movie was just an overwrought rehash of "Belly", without the more focused screenplay and better cinematic qualities of the F. Gary Gray film. After coasting along for two hours (that seemed more like four), full of conclusive scenes that make you think (hope) that it's over, the movie ends in a ridiculous cliff-hanger. I suppose the sequel will contain the only cliché that wasn't thrown in: the car chase. This was an insipid, amoral film that couldn't seem to decide what story it wanted to tell. Watch Belly, State Property, Get Rich or Die Trying, or any of the hordes of other similarly themed films and you won't have to torture yourself with this debacle.
