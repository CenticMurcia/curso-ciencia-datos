This is what movies should be... A mix of whatever grasps the writers creative soul and splashes it on the backdrop in a red streak of blood. Seriously this movie is not for the average. It's very out there and has very heavy accents. If you don't mind such things and seek to find somethin which is a true art piece then you have found it. A perfect blend of the old and new, of east and west. A mashing of the old Kurosawa films with the spaghetti western remakes we in North America are so fond of. If you are a fan of Asian cinema you'll find that every character is so perfectly what you expect and then some (Im not gonna bother with spoilers cuz it plays it out for itself). I am so inspired by this film I'm gonna hunt down the original Django. I highly advise this for art house film lovers (as well as Tarantino fans). Best movie I've seen in a long while. Enjoy!
