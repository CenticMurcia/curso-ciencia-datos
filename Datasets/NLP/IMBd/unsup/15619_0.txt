I hate to be a spoilsport, and would not wish to hurt the feelings of the Portuguese director, aged 100 this year (assuming he is still alive), but this is really a terrible film. It is so badly made, so badly directed, so badly edited, that it can only be described as appallingly amateur. People make better films than that now with their mobile phones. I suppose that the dinner table discussion in the film between Catherine Deneuve, John Malkovich, Stefania Sandrelli and Irene Papas (bizarrely taking place in four languages, and everyone pretends to understand Papas's Greek!), must have been arranged as a tribute to the man who persisted in writing and directing this film despite being in his nineties. It was a touching gesture on their part to honour him and help him out, but the result is not something to boast about. The general idea of having a woman and her little girl visiting all those interesting places like Istanbul, and constituting a rather more intellectual travelogue than is usual in TV documentaries, was a sound one. But the execution of this idea was a total failure. I think it best if we were to draw a polite and discreet veil over this project, which may have been worthy but was not worthwhile.
