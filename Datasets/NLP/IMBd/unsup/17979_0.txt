Dennis Mitchell (Mason Gamble) is a five year old boy, who's clever and always curious. Which Dennis doesn't meant to be a bad little boy. But his neighbor George Wilson (Walter Matthau) is been suffering for some time, Because of Dennis' antics. When a poor, grease thief (Christopher Lloyd) comes to Dennis' home town for robberies. But he didn't think that he can't match with this little kid.<br /><br />Directed by Nick Castle (The Boy Who Could Fly, The Last Starfighter, Major Payne) made an amusing comedy family film, which is based on a comic-strip by Hank Ketcham. Gamble is very likable in the title role. Matthau is perfectly cast as Mr. Wilson. The Cast includes:Joan Plowright, Lea Thompson, Robert Stanton and Paul Winfield. But the Script, Written by John Hughes (The Breakfest Club, National Lampoon's Vacation, Pretty in Pink). Who also produced this film manages to somewhat rip-off his "Home Alone" style mischief violence for laughs. Which isn't that bad, since it was a modest hit at the box office and audiences of all ages should enjoy this. Watch for a young Natasha Lyonne for a bit part and Devin Ratray from the "Home Alone" fame. (*** 1/2 out of *****).
