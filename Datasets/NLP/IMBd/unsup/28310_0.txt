Without any doubt, this was the absolute worst movie I have ever rented. I absolutely am shocked that Blockbuster would offer shelf space to such an amateurish, student-quality film. Forget the R rating; this film gets an F.<br /><br />To be as fair as possible, the general plot idea about an agoraphobic trapped in her haunted apartment presents a novel dilemma, so interesting we decided to rent the movie. But that is where any promise of a good or even average movie ends. While there are a few (very few) moments that, if properly developed, would have been truly frightening, nothing ever develops. The story meanders with superfluous characters and disjointed scenes. Overall, I could not shake the feeling that the cast and crew believed this movie could be another Blair Witch Project. It isn't by any stretch.<br /><br />Perhaps it was the rush to get the movie finished, or perhaps the script was not fully developed prior to shooting, or perhaps the producers should have spent more time finding a lead actor with some actual acting talent, whatever the reason, the end product is truly horrific--for all the wrong reasons.
