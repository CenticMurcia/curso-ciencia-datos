So many other comments have already been made that I would have included in my comment here, so I will make this brief: I love this movie. I rented it from Blockbuster because one of 3 favourite actresses is in it: Brittany Murphy, and because I'm a martial arts fan, and I'd just started reading up on Mark Dacascos. This movie is just so darn cool and fun and amazing. "Drive" is the only movie to have challenged the long-standing position held by "Drunken Master 2" as my favourite action movie of all time. The only gripes I have about the movie are these: I don't like the title. "Drive" is a inappropriate title for the movie. I recently saw the movie "Road Rage" and thought that "Drive" would have been a good title for that movie. Anyway, I also didn't like Kadeem Hardison's character; I get so tired of stereotypical Black/African-American (whichever term is proper this month) character's like his, especially in action movies. The only other gripe I have is the "hanging from the fan" scene fromt he barroom fight. That's it. Just a really cool, fun movie. I recently got the UK DVD of this movie, and it's so full of neat extras. Get it on DVD if you can.
