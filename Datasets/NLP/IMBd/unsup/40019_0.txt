I wonder why this flick get R-rating.Yes,it has two nice sex scenes and nothing more.No gore,no real suspense,no intresting plot-everything here is so boring and lame,that after watching one hour of this crap I felt asleep.Please,I beg of you,if you find this title collecting dust somewhere, don't rent it.I give it 1.5, maybe 2 out of 10.
