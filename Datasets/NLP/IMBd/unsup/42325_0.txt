It sounds like to shot to the Red Cross. I knew in advance which kind of movie it would be. You could classify Eurotrip in the same genre as American Pie movies, Scary Movie: (for 16-24 y.o.) American erotic comedies (I'm 24 yo). Not my favorite genre, but watchable. Eurotrip however disappointed me within this genre. At least American Pie had a sense of innovation. Scary Movie was fun even if you can't appreciate the sense of humor or the story line: it's a great movie to watch because it keeps the audience entertained by the parody it brings. Those things I missed in Eurotrip. Eurotrip is a banal movie which uses dull jokes: nor fish neither meat. It is meant to be ti-tty comedy but it ends up as politically correct, prude and naive comedy. The best thing in this movie I would say, was the scenery; and the only good gag is when the friend of the boy is in the swimming pool with the blond girl. The Italian dubbing sucks (to partially justify my disgust). 3.5 out of 10 (i give 0.5 for free, I'm not cheap)
