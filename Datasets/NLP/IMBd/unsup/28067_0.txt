What lifts Cop beyond the range of a normal action film is James Woods's multi-layered performance in the lead. His investigation into a woman's death reveals a serial killer at work, one who's been plying his trade for about 15 years. The problem is that Woods can't convince the police brass of his suspicions, they don't want to alarm the public. He even has a problem with his partner, Charles Durning on the issue.<br /><br />The connection to these crimes has something to do with feminist author Lesley Ann Warren and what happened back in high school which coincidentally enough is the same alma mater for Woods. Warren's cooperation has to be dragged out of her, she's not able to comprehend that she is the key to the killings.<br /><br />Woods as the detective is at once dedicated, arrogant, tender, and quite the misogynist on occasion. Any one of these emotions is hard enough, but James Woods manages to achieve them all, sometimes all of them at once. Whatever else he is, he's a man convinced of the rightness of his course and nothing is deterring him whatsoever.<br /><br />Also in the cast is Charles Haid, late of Hill Street Blues who also is part of the mystery. He too is an alumnus of the high school. Haid plays a sleazy deputy LA County sheriff and plays it well.<br /><br />For fans of James Woods, an absolute must for them.
