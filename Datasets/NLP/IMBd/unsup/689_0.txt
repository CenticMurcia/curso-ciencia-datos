I think Rona da Ricci (Maria) is one of the most beautiful women I've ever seen. If anyone has any pictures, information or her phone number, I'd be very interested...<br /><br />This is a horrifically dark adaptation of Edgar Allen Poe's story, set in the oppressively religious society of Spain at the time of the Inquisition. The film is well-written, although a few things don't quite sit right with me. Firstly, the comic relief character is a bit vacuous. (At least, I think he was supposed to be funny...) Secondly, there is reference to the Roman Catholic Church trying to stop the Grand Inquisitor from murdering innocent people in the name of God. I somehow doubt that the organization that instigated and perpetuated these massacres over the centuries, in whatever manifestation worked for the time and place, would turn so vehemently against it at any stage, let alone against a wing of it's own organization. I think it was something of a cop-out on the part of the creators of this film. Apart from this, however, the film is enthralling, intriguing and predominately well-acted (though the male lead leaves something to be desired). Also, the cinematography deserves a mention.<br /><br />Not for everyone, but if you have a strong stomach, it's definitely worth a look.
