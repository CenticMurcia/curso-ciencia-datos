I was 9 years old when this piece of crap was released at the theaters in Sweden. I loved the book and I still cannot believe that Astrid Lindgren sold the rights to these filmmakers (she later made the same mistake with the animated Pippi Longstocking). Several of her books had already been adapted to TV and cinema prior to this, with Swedish directors, screen-writers and actors. All of those adaptations are far superior to this one. This is just stupid and has lost all the subtle nuances, the moods and the atmosphere of the book. I remember realizing this at the age of 9, and that should give you an idea about how stupid this movie is. As for the music that everyone seems to love...IT IS PURE CRAP. Panflute player Dana Dragomir is one of the cheesiest musicians I know of, and the music is just a sweet, sugary mess. These are thoughts I also remember having in 1987. Horrible. Please, remake! Why not animated by Miyazaki, who is a big fan of Lindgren, and one of the few who seem to understand that less is always more. And please, everyone read the book instead of seeing the movie. This might be one of the worst adaptations of all time!
