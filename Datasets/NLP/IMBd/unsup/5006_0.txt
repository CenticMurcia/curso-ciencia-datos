I just loved this movie. It kept my interest in a most peculiar way, and it took me nearly to the end of the picture before I figured it out. None of the key scenes were ever emphasized with dramatic music swelling up, down, or out....anywhere. In fact, it did not have any music except for the piano playing in one scene. Most unusual. This movie came across almost as "play-like", without the typical "movie" accents. Very different, very good. The only drawback, if you can really call it that, was the distraction of James Mason made up to be a man much older than his original years when he made this. The make up artist utilized a lot of "spirit-gum" that was used around his face, and unfortunately, it is noticeable in many scenes. But don't let that deter you from seeing this wonderful film!
