If you like action movies, this film is for you. If you like gentle comedy, this film is also for you. If you've only seen Chow Yun-Fat playing suave, "hard boiled" killers this film is *definitely* one you should see. Breathtaking action sequences pepper a sweet plot about the triumph of innocence over arrogance and the power of love and friendship.<br /><br />Plus you get to see Chow Yun-Fat walking around with Mickey Mouse balloons.<br /><br />5 stars out of 5. One of my favorite HK comedies.
