I saw this movie on cable today because there was nothing else on and actually enjoyed it. The promos did not make the movie seem interesting, nor did the reviews, which is why I was in no rush to see it. I found Hav Plenty to be a very entertaining and charming romantic comedy (I'm not sure if I would feel the same way if I actually drove to the movie theatre and paid $7). All of the characters were likable and Cherot as Lee was endearing. Even Hav, played by Maxwell, who comes off as a superbitch in the beginning of the movie, grows on you. Cherot is a natural actor and has lots of talent. The performances were very down-to-earth with no frills. I hope to see more of Cherot's work.
