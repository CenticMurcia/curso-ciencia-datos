Veterans Borgnine and Lupino (who was also part of the cast of the awful "the food of the gods") tried to regain prestige in horror movies as Bette Davis or Joan Bennett did.But "the devil's rain" was not a good choice,by a long shot.The story is nonexistent,I dare anybody to find something looking like a plot in this flick.Pre-"Star trek" William Shattner is tortured all film long.Pre-"Saturday night fever" Travolta is featured,but where? Special effects are ridiculous,overlong ,and the sect chants in the grand tradition of "Rosemary's baby" .Satan inspired a lot of movies,but this one seems the worst of them all.Avoid at any price.
