Impossible to watch without entertaining the ghost of Richard Linklater (Before Sunrise/Before Sunset). Indeed Delpy clearly has the aesthetic, subject material and script content in her own mind as well. It is a great testament to her that this is an idiosyncratic, coherent and self- contained rom-com in the metropolitan tradition of Annie Hall.<br /><br />It helps that she persuaded Adam Goldberg to play her lover. He's a fine actor (look no further than Linklater's own Dazed and Confused, no less) but here he's careful not to overplay the Jewish weltschmerz. He's attentive to the chief protagonist being the relationship that the two principals have and not each of them individually. Delpy also does a fine job given that she's clearly shuttling between different ends of the camera - not too 'kooky'.<br /><br />The ensemble cast is well taken without reserve, all creating striking but not overpowering characters along the way. The film is shot largely hand-held and jumps through the episodes with an energy that goes with the purported watershed age of Jack and Marion (they're meant to be 35). I liked it very much. 7.5/10
