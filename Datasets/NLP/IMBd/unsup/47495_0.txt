A blob from outerspace comes to the beach and hangs out in a cave. Only children are attuned to the blob and it tells them what to do in order to sabotage, The Thunderer! Apart from that rather thin plot line, we are treated to Jackie Coogan in a fuzzy bath robe and really short shorts (frightening). Russel Johnson departs from his lovable Professor persona and plays a drunk who is struck down by the blob. And there's the guy from "North By Northwest" who plays the father of two of our mysterious children. He's married to the twisty faced woman from "The Screaming Skull" so all in all, it's a film for the ages. Be sure to watch this one with Mike, Tom, and Crow otherwise you might feel compelled to smash something at the end of it
