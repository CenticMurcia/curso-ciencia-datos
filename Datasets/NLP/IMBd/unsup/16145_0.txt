I know a lot of people on here gave this movie a bad review, but when I read those the only words going through my head are "What the f**k???" Geez, people. Don't you get it? The point of this movie is to be a spoof of all the other lame ones, but to be enjoyable because it's not really one of those at all. I mean, it is (but only because it's spoofing...SPOOF-ING!), but it has a good sense of humor and tone to it. I couldn't get enough of the dog. I taped it back in...probably 6th grade, and I'm planning on watching it tonight!!! I really enjoy this movie because, who can't love a dog with such a human-like character to him? Hmm??? And the people he meets along the way too, haha. It's great. It's a great comedy, I love the part where the crooks are trapped by the police and they realize all the hostages are gone, so they look at Bingo and in the next scene they grab the dog and say "one move and the dog gets it!"...well, it's funnier in the movie. But it's definitely worth the watch. I mean, if you keep an open mind and don't act like the rest of these dufuses who probably started the movie with a negative response and kept with it not even WANTING to enjoy it. Geez, give it a chance. And even if you don't like it, I think it was worth the experience. Either way there are funny parts in the movie. Has Lassie ever gone to jail? Has Willy ever been to a place where they serve killer whale meat on the menu?????? Well, have they?! No. So watch it because it's a SPOOF, not just "another" one of those movies. It's great for everyone...except for angry men, and bitchy women.
