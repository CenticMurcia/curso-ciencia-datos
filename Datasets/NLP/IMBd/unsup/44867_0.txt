OMFG that freaking bear scene! O.K on with it. I have to say that this is indeed one of, if not the worst movie i have ever seen. Even though it was funny beyond words it is still a very very bad movie, everything in it, there is now faint sign of hope for any of those people who participated in it. The funny thing about that is, that history proved that wrong, Arnold actually turned out to be an extraordinary actor with a successful career. See thats surprising when you watch this movie! And back to that god forbidden bear scene. I must say that from the moment I saw the bear I cried with laughter. I really can't see how anyone, anyone of any time can be so thickheaded that they actually make such a costume, and even worse uses it for the movie. And well there is a lot of other unbelievable details in this movie, in fact the entire movie is a huge surprise, I mean Zeus' thunderbolts are actually made of steel bars normally used for supporting concrete structures, and it is obvious if you look at them. Well I could go on with these, excuse me, hopeless and stupid details ( as well as the entire main plot )but I guess there is nothing more to say, a very very bad movie beyond words. I encourage ANYONE with my heart and soul to watch it. Better laughs are rarely found, and besides it is a suitable tribute to Arnold to watch this one from start to finish, a never forgotten movie in history, and it really sucks! Though it is indeed supreme if you need one and a half hours of cheep laughs i rate it 1 because it is technically the worst movie i have seen. 1/10
