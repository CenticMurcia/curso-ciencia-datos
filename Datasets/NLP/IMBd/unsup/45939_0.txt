Pure drivel! It takes a few stiff drinks and the Satellite of Love to sit through this one. It's a '1' alone and an '8' with Mike Nelson and his robot friends. The historical portrayals are god-awful and inaccurate, the dialogue is purile, and the plot is splattered onto the screen in such a way that to attempt to understand what's going on will only make you cry.
