Setting: Island of St. Pierre off of France (part of French Republic) in the year 1849-50.<br /><br />Plot: A guillotine named "the widow" is being brought over to the island from France to execute a man who at the beginning of the movie got so drunk he killed a man without any deep human evil as motive. The "problem" is St. Pierre is a gentle community and has no executioners that not even any of their sailors would bring any to the island. No executioner, no head. <br /><br />Madame La (Juliette Binoche) is such a gentle soul living there who believes the man is good and useful to the community but also hidden under the surface is innocently sexually obsessed with the man before she even really meets him which is what much of the community thinks she is leaning toward, especially some bored debutantes which are like counterparts to Juliette's character. Her husband is the warden of the penitentiary (Daniel Auteuil) under Paris headquarters but technically has jurisdiction because they are not in Paris so he allows the condemned to be at his wife's disposal because he supports her and they love each other, which is seen as signs of weakness by the ferocious Paris French Republic putting pressure on the local Republic making such questions arise: do humans make the law or does the law make us? Surely nobody in St. Pierre not having endured the repression of France needs to make examples by collecting heads except for the cowardly governor and admirals who are paid to appear strong. Of course there's a quote (i forget who it belongs), and i'm paraphrasing saying "real strength is having the power to destroy, but choosing not to". Madame La's lust for the condemned is no exception to this rule--her love having conquered all.
