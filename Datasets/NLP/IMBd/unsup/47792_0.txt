I bought this at Wherehouse Music for $6 and its not worth 6 cents. i would have returned but it was a going out of business purchase so i ended up giving it away to my fiance's parents. They hated it also and are trying to find someone else to take it off their hands. It's another in a long line of "spoofs" of horror movies, it tries to be funny and tongue in cheek but its just total garbage, don't waste your time watching this.<br /><br />Davey M.
