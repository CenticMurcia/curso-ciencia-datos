This was a terrible movie! A 40 year old guy and a 30 year old girl playing two teenage boys?! Totally pointless! But one or two jokes made me smile a while. But maybe it`s just not my sense of humor because two of my friend thought it was hysterical amusing, but as I said I thought it was boring. One scene though when Kevin (I think) gets all red in the face, that`s fun! But nothing I recommend, sorry to all you Kevin and Perry fans. //Sofia
