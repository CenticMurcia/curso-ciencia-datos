When the series Hollywood was made in the late 1970s, it's producers had more than enough material for a series of over 10 episodes (as it was shown). Especially the material dealing with interviews of silent film period survivors. The producers decided to do several follow-up documentaries. Three eventually were made, about Chaplin, Keaton, and Lloyd. This was the first. Taken from the Chaplin family film vaults, it showed (in three episodes) scenes that were filmed by Chaplin from movies that were actually finished but re-cut (like CITY LIGHTS, THE CIRCUS, and THE CURE), as well as films that were made for private viewing (a film with visitor Sir Harry Lauder), and film that was created for projects that did not work out. It was a wonderful series, and all too brief - mostly due to the tragic fact that Chaplin did not save all the cut material from all his projects and films. Try to catch this on DVD.
