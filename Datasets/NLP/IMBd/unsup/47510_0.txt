I went to see this movie in hopes that it would be nearly as brilliant as Young Frankenstien. On opening weekend Saturday matin√©e there were about 15 people in the cinema and half of them walked out during the first 10 minutes while making loud offensive comments. I was pretty embarrassed for Mr. Brooks. I stayed and watched the whole thing. Unfortunately for me I found myself groaning more than laughing during this goofy spoof. I'm sure they had lots of fun making the movie because they look like they're having fun but it struck me as schlock. I'm sorry to have to say such things about a film made by one of my favorite directors but I could have waited to see it on T.V. OUCH!
