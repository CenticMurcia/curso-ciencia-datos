Witty, dark, and just hot!! American fans want SEASON #3!!!! It is unfair to bring the U.S. this jewel to sci-fi/fantasy fans who fall in love with HEX, to then be disappointed by not producing a Season #3. Buffy is gone,Angel, Dead like Me, and Charmed, now this too!!! It is a travesty with all of the crap movies and TV that is produced to lose this show called Hex that is so refreshing in the land of crap TV such as One tree Hill, Pepper Dennis, and pretty much all of the other shows being produced for TV!!! I really want to stop falling for the shows that have cult followings. Legions of fans that the networks do not care about or listen to when they are asked to bring them back!!! Maybe we could petition the Sci-Fi network to stop making crap made for TV movies and help produce shows like Hex for true fans who would tune in worldwide!!
