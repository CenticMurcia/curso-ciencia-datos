If it weren't for MST3K, cheese like this would be lost forever. Leave it to the crew of the Satellite of Love to make a bad movie seem okay. The poacher finding the eggs is funny, "If you wanna make a movie, you gotta break some eggs..." but outside of the lines Crow provides for Trumpy, little of this movie is worth talking about. My major quarrel with this film is the complete and total disregard of time. And the lack of trust in its audience. Okay, so I guess that's two major quarrels. I guess my favorite bit is from Trumpy eating the peanuts: KID: These we'll put away for later. CROW: No, more. KID: Now we can play. CROW: Like hell, more food.<br /><br />Thank you MST3K.
