I found this terrible. Please, don't bother even LOOKING at the case. I shudder each time I think of it. Raul Julia would be turning in his grave.<br /><br />Tim Curry. A name known throughout the world. He is a brilliant actor and I have found his other work to be particularly enjoyable- emphasis on OTHER. He seems so intent to replicate Raul Julia that he doesn't (replicate him). Gomez is terribly out of character and is rather more like a prim English butler in a Gomez suit than Gomez Addams. Was he so far in Raul Julia's shadow that he could not bring his own skills to the movie? Daryl Hannah at least I expected something worthwhile from. I've seen reviews that sang her praises and found myself utterly disappointed. She tries so hard to imitate the fey-like quality that Anjelica Huston brought to the character that I almost pity her because she overdoes it. Her features are distinctly different from that of Huston's and her overall looks are too perfect to really make Morticia come alive.<br /><br />And where are the most classic parts of the couple's relationship? As shown in The Addams Family and Addams Family Values, Gomez and Morticia are unashamed by their blatant displays of affection- affection so overwhelming that at certain points it becomes almost corny in Addams Family Reunion. Not once do we see Gomez trailing kisses along Morticia's arm (a near trademark) and in the beginning of the movie where we are offered a tidbit of the two in bed together, which I suppose is meant to be teasing, I was surprised to find that the scene incorporated none of the sensuality that accompanied Gomez and Morticia in the previous two movies. NGAH. CANON HAS BEEN MURDERED.<br /><br />Don't even look in this movie's direction.
