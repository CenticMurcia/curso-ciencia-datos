Just like the first, this little movie is still just as cute, and remains as a great piece of entertainment for children, even if it is straight-to-TV material. From the acting to the story, all is adequate for the kind of end result those behind the scenes were imagining.<br /><br />There's a lot less "scary images" than the first, and a lot more mystery to intrigue your 11-year-old child. From the slapstick to the one-liners, the comedy will work nicely as well.<br /><br />All in all, I highly recommend a family to watch this in October. It's completely harmless and innocent, and its targeted audience is sure to find entertainment in it.
