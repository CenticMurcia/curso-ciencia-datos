It shocks me to think there are IMDb reviewers out there who would give this sordid piece of uninteresting, uninspiring, unsurprising, total waste of potential film acting a 10 rating! Never had I painfully sat through such a bomb hoping that the film would just get better because others enjoyed it. Don't waste your time. You're better off getting a cheap B-flick that is campy and fun. This ain't it.
