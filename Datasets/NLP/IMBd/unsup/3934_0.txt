The trailer to this movie looked like it offered something new, but it was awful. WARNING!!!!!!!!!!! SPOILERS AHEAD!!!!!!!!! You feel a bit different about Heather Grahm after seeing this movie, since 9/10 of her screen time she is having sex with Ryan Phillipe. Gregg Araki seems to do whatever it takes to prove how original his movie is, but it just ends up being stupid. One guy explodes, and when the blood settles, a giant beetle is in his place.(The beetle even talks)A guys nipple rings are torn off. James Duval is the main character, Dark ("As in absence of light" he points out) and he is a terrible actor. Rachael True is his girlfriend, and she talks like shes trying to create a new accent or something, and that's irratating. The good parts of this movie( there are very few) are Mena Suvari(her debut movie, she wasn't that great but I'm a fan) Chistina Applegate with braces, a spanking scene, and John Ritter as a "preist" who sends kids messages of suicide. This movie was awful.
