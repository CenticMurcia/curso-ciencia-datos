Yes, he is indeed! <br /><br />*SPOILERS*<br /><br />Pompous Agar and Ward and The Load go down in a hole and get trapped when a guy gets hit in the head by falling rock. They find themselves in front of a cavern that isn't natural, or, as Tom puts it, "a perverted UNNATURAL cavern!" They go down it and a mole hand pokes out of the wall, which, of course, they don't see, because the Load has the vapors. They have to practically carry the fat guy all the way down to a big 'ol painted backdrop where they take up residence right where one of the moles pops up to say HEY HO. Well, after a good shot of Venus the Nothingo, moles come and put sacks over their heads, dragging them into the ground and putting them in a room where they will be nicely kept docile. Well, here's three lines from the greatest MST3K episode to ever hit TV that explains the next scene.<br /><br />Crow: TERROR ELVES!!!!<br /><br />Tom: Oh, you never would believe where those Keebler cookies come from!<br /><br />Mike: Santa will see you now.<br /><br />Yes, the terror elves come down with their little wooden swords and Peter Pan outfits and take the three away to their king, Lieutenant Crown-Roast and his priest, Alfred the Butler, who wears a snood. They decide to kill them, and the three don't take partial to this idea. Well, John the Pompous A** shines a flashlight on 'em and melts some elves, because they run away from 'light that is slightly brighter than what [they're] used to, NO!!!' Uh-huh, they do. And so that begins the fact that they now think that the three are gods and John the Pompous A** loves to cultivate this image. Anyway, yadda yadda yadda, there is some stuff in between all that, but it really doesn't matter, does it? Just remember that John knows everything. He does, he can explain things just like he's known it forever. Interesting, no?<br /><br />I gave it three stars, partially because it is the genre of B movies, and it deserves it. And, I give it **********/***** for the MST3K version. This has got to be their finest. It has hilarious lines, especially about the entire Load section, and, well, to sum it up, it is a da** fine thing to laugh at. You gotta see it!!! Watch it with Mike and the Bots, but only with them.
