I am so tired of people applauding films just because they are old. This film out & out sucked. Not scary, not funny, not clever or good for 1 minute! Absolutely awful. An utter waste of time & I can not stand when people say to please not remake this. Why not? Worst case scenario it won't be as awful. I've heard about them remaking this and took advice to rent the original. To hear it was nominated at one time is unacceptable. Geesh. The same year Giant came out this actually graced that stage. I recommend you do not waste your time. save your money.Stay home and watch American Idol. The girl on that show would be more interesting.
