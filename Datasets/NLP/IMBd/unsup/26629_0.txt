I have seen "Mask" many times and it remains one of my favorites, since the first time I saw it in 1986. Rocky Dennis was a true inspiration and a wonderful human being. We can all learn a lesson from Rocky. Cher, Eric Stoltz, and Sam Elliott were the perfect cast to tell this true story of Rocky, and they did an awesome job. Cher has stated that it was her favorite film to make, and Sam Elliott is sexier than ever. Eric, of course was wonderful as Rocky Dennis. The music used in the film is excellent and appropriate, Lynard Skynard, Springsteen, Bob Seagar, Little Richard, Steely Dan, and The Grateful Dead to name a few.. A great classic Rock soundtrack should be made available from this film!
