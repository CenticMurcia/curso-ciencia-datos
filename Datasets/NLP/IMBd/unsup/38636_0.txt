This movie is glossy and a seemingly realistic portrayal of Pakistan and the effects of terrorism on a victim's family and friends.<br /><br />But what a dismal story. The outcome is no surprise. We saws it on CNN, remember? The character of Daniel Pearl comes across as rather unlikable. He pursues a really dangerous story without regard for the fate of his pregnant wife. When he disappears, he becomes the Center of the Known Universe, but the movie fails to justify the effort put into the Search For Danny. Still, there is not even a pretense of suspense. We KNOW he's doomed. We saw it on CNN.<br /><br />So, I'm left wondering why this movie was made. We gain no information we didn't already have. We "learn" that Karachi is a large and chaotic city. So? We learn that terrorism causes horrific pain in its victims and their families. And? Cops use all sorts of unconventional means (even torture!) to get information about terrorists. Sorry. I think that's been covered on "24". And some victims die. Hmmm. They are called victims, right? Oh, and high profile cases draw huge packs of intrusive journalists. Well, both Daniel and Mariane Pearl were journalists, so why would this be a surprise? Why does this case rate a Major Motion Picture when so many other journalists, soldiers and civilians have been kidnapped and killed over the years. What makes Danny so special? <br /><br />After subjecting myself to this 2 hours of futile angst, I have no idea how to answer that question. So, why bother?
