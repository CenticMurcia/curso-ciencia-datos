Bad, Bad, Awful........It was the worst film I have ever seen. It was dragged on for about three hours and in the end you were given a question mark. Bad acting, awful music and dancing, and the story line was boring. I don't know why so many people gave it such a good rating, it baffles me. Other people's comments lead me to watch this awful movie. There are so many other good French movies, why waste your time with this one? Where to begin with the horror, the acting. The main character Louise looks like a bad Audrey Hepburn. In the beginning of the movie she has just come out of a coma and is said to be weak. Though that didn't stop her from fighting a guy who was attacking her bodyguard. Much of the story line seemed extremely fictional and confusing. One Instance of this is when her bodyguard somehow turns into her lover over night. Then there is Ida, a girl who was adopted as a child and is now longing to know where she comes from. Ida's story is the most confusing, because you're left wondering why the script writers put it in the movie. It is the shortest and has no significance in the movie. The last girl in the movie is Ninon, a trouble maker who finally tries to do right with Louise. Let's just say I didn't like the way she broke out in abstract dance where ever she went. It was bad from the beginning till the end, and from the script to the music.
