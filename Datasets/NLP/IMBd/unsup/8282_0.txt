The always watchable Dirk Bogarde is in top form as a nasty piece of fatherhood here. But the children match him for acting ability, I must say. Even the youngest girl, who is Phoebe Nicholls of Brideshead Revisited (TV) fame some years later. Everyone in this quietly creepy film does a good job with their characters. This is just the sort of intelligent story the British do so well. It captures its period skillfully, and I found myself wanting to "enter" the story to help the characters out! One really feels for the children's plight. Yet, they ARE capable creatures. (They put one in mind of English books such as E. Nesbit's The Wouldbegoods, not that the story is nearly as pleasant, but because the children are so good at looking after themselves independently.) <br /><br />I have always found these atmospheric English films far superior to slam-bang American entertainment. Not to everyone's taste, perhaps, but that makes it more fun, too. Whistle Down the Wind comes to mind as a similarly enjoyable essay on quirky childhood experiences.
