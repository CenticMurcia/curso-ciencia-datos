Lord knows Rod Serling tried to write comedy for his great series, but the results were almost always trite and heavy-handed. This one, though often maligned by the "experts", is truly delightful (and yes...I realize that comedy is very subjective). <br /><br />There are some slow, repetitious moments in the main confrontation between Rance and the real Jesse (which could have been solved with more inventive direction)....but otherwise, Chris Nyby's work is first-rate. The entire first half is just CRAZY--a beautifully staged "chamber-comedy" in which we find ourselves enmeshed in the quirky interplay between a tedious, pampered boor and the behind-the-scenes mechanics of TV make-believe. And for once, here's a running gag that actually works!--- Rance's bad habit of wildly flinging his six-shooter in the direction of the mirror mounted behind the bar. <br /><br />The real pitfall of this brand of satire is the tendency to play too broadly..but Larry Blyden's performance is beautifully balanced and controlled, as is that of Robert Cornthwaite, who could always be counted on for a first-rate job. Arch Johnson is also dead-on.<br /><br />From Rance's nutty first entrance to the hilarious concluding plot twist, Serling managed to crank out his best comedy while buried under the stress of his third full season of production. And Fred Steiner's (uncredited) "hoe-down" music adds the final touch of brilliance to this underrated gem.
