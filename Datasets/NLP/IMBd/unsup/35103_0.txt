It's a little funny, the Yiddish makes it interesting, but a lot of silly comments and it sounds like bitter depressed person with a lot of issues wrote it up, very very bad ending, not a real ending to the movie.<br /><br />It's very fake and not the real life in the Hasidic community, boys are smarter then this boy sounds, he knows how to take a train and get around the city and goes to clubs but cant buy himself a pair of jeans.<br /><br />If you are not an orthodox Jew you will hate this movie, if you are an orthodox Jew you will find it a little funny and very stupid The Yiddish speaking sounds very annoying it sound more like Russian Jews with bad Yiddish.<br /><br />The education in the yeshivas from this movie sounds like these boys are told to study religion all day long I wonder how and why you see young Jewish boys who are very successful in business without any education
