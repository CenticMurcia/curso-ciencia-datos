The most boring film I saw in recent years. Lots of talking, TV- like acting for displaying total uninteresting and clich√© people. There simply is not a single sign of action in the first 20 minutes after the title credits. Is this a mafia film or not ? Where is the gang war the DVD cover talks about? Most annoying is the restaurant owner who keeps reciting Shakespeare one liners all the time. You will loose interest in this poor "main character" fastly. I am honest to say that I saw the rest (after the first 20 min of pure boredom) accelerated, in 4 time - 8 times DVD speed. It keeps being lame. I'm just glad that I didn't spend more time with this total failure film.
