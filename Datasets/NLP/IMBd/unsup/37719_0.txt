What could have been an interesting idea was spoilt by the lack of any character development. We are given no insight into why an ex-convict, freshly out of prison and having been given a new start, would throw it all away by immediately commencing random and seemingly motiveless killings within the building.<br /><br />Given that there were only FOUR tenants in the whole block, wasn't it verging on the ridiculous to start killing them all off - what was he planning to do when they were all dead?<br /><br />The ending was a slightly unexpected "twist", and a minor payoff for making it through to the end this poorly acted, non-scary horror film.
