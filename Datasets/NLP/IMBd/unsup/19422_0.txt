The late, great, sorely missed tough guy supreme Steve McQueen gives a typically cool, laconic and utterly engaging performance as rugged, but weary modern-day bounty hunter Ralph "Papa" Thorson, who goes after dangerous criminals who have skipped bail and has trouble adjusting to an ever-changing world he feels increasingly out of place in. Directed in a rather plain, yet still effective manner by TV show veteran Buzz Kulik, this movie has a certain rough look and gritty atmosphere to it that's gripping and believable. The pace is a bit slow, but fitfully steady just the same. The action sequences are very lively, riveting and exciting; two highlights are a stirring chase between a wheat thresher and a Trans Am in a corn field and a wild lengthy set piece towards the end which starts out as a foot chase and ultimately culminates into a car chase (the whole sequence on a speeding subway train totally smokes). Both Michel Legrand's rousing score and Fred Koenekamp's smooth photography are on the money fine. The topflight supporting cast constitutes as another substantial plus: Kathryn Harrold as Thorson's loving, but long-suffering pregnant school teacher girlfriend, Eli Wallach as a crusty bail bondsman, Levar Burton as a nice young guy who befriends Thorson, Ben Johnson as an ornery sheriff, and the ever-creepy Tracey Walter as a crazed, vengeful ex-con with a personal grudge against Thorson. McQueen's reliably strong, personable and charismatic screen presence really holds the picture together; McQueen brings a likability and vulnerability to Thorson that's refreshing and appealing in equal measure. Unjustly reviled by most critics during its theatrical release, "The Hunter" overall sizes up as an extremely solid and satisfying little ripper that's well worth checking out by both Steve McQueen fans and action movie buffs alike.
