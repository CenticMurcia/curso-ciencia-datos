This a terrible movie with a terrible story. It's low budget, so, of course, I forgive the acting and production flaws. But there's no excuse for a bad story. A down-on-his-luck clown who is determined to make it as a clown, decides to become a stripper clown and market himself as a joke for bachelor parties. His first gig goes really bad. A turn of events makes him rich and famous, but that bad gig comes back to haunt him. I rented this movie because of the Kevin Smith connection, since I'm a huge Smith fan. Don't make the same mistake I did.
