We need movies like this. we need to allow ourselves to be touched. <br /><br />So we can learn to be human beings, people need to learn to be humane to each other. Forget gender, forget color, forget beliefs, we all human underneath, we all drown, we all bleed, we all are scared, we all want to express ourselves, and we all deserve that respect.<br /><br />Learn to give that to everyone you meet. You might never see them again. <br /><br />I feel privileged these people shared their lives with me. We can learn so much from what the people in this documentary are sharing with us about community, and culture, and humanity.
