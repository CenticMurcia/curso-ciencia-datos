I love this show!!! I love that it's a bit campy.<br /><br />Cast is great!!! I would love to see this show for more seasons.<br /><br />Eric Johnson as Flash is just perfect.<br /><br />Anna Van Hooft as Aura is very likable. She plays her part very well.<br /><br />John Ralston adds just enough "evil".<br /><br />It seems that every member is really getting into the characters that they play.<br /><br />I think it's way cool that they are spending so much time on developing the characters and adding new groups of people every week.<br /><br />The story is believable and has continuity.<br /><br />I'm not sure why we need 10 lines.<br /><br />GO FLASH!!!
