Who's idea was it to give Leo Dicaprio the lead for this film? I would like to know the reasoning behind that selection. Maybe it was the same person who decided that Cameron Diaz should have been given the role of Jenny. Neither one of those two had any business being in the movie. Was New York really that horrible in the 1860s? I'm going to have to do some research to find out. That's really the only thing I got out of the film - an interest in New York during the Civil War.
