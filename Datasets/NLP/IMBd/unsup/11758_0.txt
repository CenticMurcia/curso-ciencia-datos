Beethoven's 2nd is so cute, the puppies are adorable and the movie is funny. I think the first 2 are way better than the other sequels. It starts when Beethoven goes to the park and he finds a another Saint Bernard and her name is Missy. They soon have puppies and the kids follow Beethoven to see what he's up to and they find little Beethoven's, there all so sweet and they take them home and don't say nothing about it, for a while and the parents find out and the father says they can keep them until they can find homes for them, well I don't want to tell you the whole story so go out and see it, you will not be disappointed. If your a dog lover you'll love this movie.
