The comments on this film to date are some of the most intelligent and knowledgeable I have yet to read anywhere on the imdb site. Even those who have little use for the ideologies of the original Hollywood Ten writers and directors present some views about the film itself that make sense. It is almost as if this drama within a movie production about another movie has taken on a life of its own.<br /><br />I am particularly struck by the comments of people who actually knew either the real characters or the actors who portray them in this production. How often does one get to read that kind of material? Truly impressive.<br /><br />The film itself is without much life, unfortunately. It looks about as much like the real Silver City as some place in South Africa, with extras frequently standing around ogling the camera while Goldblum et al. speechify. I knew it was made in Spain, but why? Even the Greyhound bus sign is completely bogus for its time. And there are very few real Mexican-Americans who look or act like Spaniards, even the criollo descendants of New Mexico colonists from the seventeenth century. <br /><br />My own grandfather was a member of the union who worked the big copper pits near Silver City. He would have laughed his head off at this lame depiction of the ongoing troubles between labor and management that were far more complex and life-threatening than anything portrayed here. (And continue to a lesser scale in the mines around here even today.)<br /><br />The real Gale Sondergaard I will always remember as the quintessential German spy who scared the life out of me back in the early 40's.
