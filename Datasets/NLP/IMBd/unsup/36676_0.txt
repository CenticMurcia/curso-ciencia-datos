Oh God, there is nothing even laughable in this Godawful film you are probably about to see. It was a large mistake, a large MODERN HORROR film mistake. It has no plot, only the story of people in the forest, involving the sasquatch. And here's a spoiler for you: YOU BARELY SEE HIM! and that's really the only reason why you would want to see the film. Blair Witch Knock off, someone should really make fun of this. First of all, we have a GOLD lead actor here, Lance Henrikson You KNOW!!! From PUMPKINHEAD and ALIENS and THE TERMINATOR, a great actor. But sadly, he's acted in a LOT of B-Flicks, and this is the BIG one, BIG-FOOT one, that is. I'm sorry this ruined your career, Lance, but I know you'll do better in the future. Anyway, avoid this AWFUL movie. Long Story Short: It won't make your hair grow up. There's just a LOT of HAIR in it
