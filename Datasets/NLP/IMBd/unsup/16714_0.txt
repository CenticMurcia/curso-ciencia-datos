I look at a lot of DVDs. This one is Katt's first and it's better than all the rest. The documentary at the beginning sets it up. We've had enough of haters and it says so. We've had enough of hurting ourselves for haters and it says so. And it's done without hating back. I like that. This is also Katt's original material. Unlike some of his other specials, this DVD is over an hour of non-stop comedy and funny! He's real natural. Not all that gimmicky stuff he does in his later shows. He does talk about the perm. He does talk about being a pimp. But it takes a backseat to his comedy. That's the difference. There's comedy in this show. It's thumbs up, 10 points and you know it from you know it.
