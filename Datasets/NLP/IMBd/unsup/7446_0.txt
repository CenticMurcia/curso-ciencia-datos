In Mercenary For Justice Steven Seagal is turning away from his recent Direct-To-DVD releases and opening with a great 'war' scene one that comes close to "Saving Private Ryan". Steven also his hearing his fan base and decided to do his own fights scenes, also at the end he gets back to his 'movie' roots when he goes after the man who set him up in the beginning. The way does it reminds me of his movies "Hard to Kill" and "Out For Justice". Steven is making an honest effort to improve and the way he acts in his movies. If he continues he will reach the stardom he had in the early 1990's and maybe in the future he will go beyond in his stardom we just have to keep him informed so that he may continue to improve.
