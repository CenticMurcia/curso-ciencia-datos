I've seen some of the original Flash Gordon serial from the 1930s/40s (and found it pretty darn cheesy, inferior to this 2007 series in acting, writing and special effects), but I mainly tuned in to this new version because I thought Eric Johnson did a good job in his supporting role on Smallville. I'm glad to see a decent actor (not just a pretty boy) get the lead role on a series for once! This role gives Eric the opportunity to display his sense of humour, which I thought I detected in a Smallville behind the scenes interview clip years ago, and wondered why that show failed to tap into.<br /><br />In fact one of the main things I enjoy about this new Flash series, is the humour in general. It's a relief to be able to watch a show that doesn't take itself too seriously, and where you can relax, have fun, and not have to worry that your favorite characters are gonna be killed off (not a spoiler, just my impression). Naturally some people prefer more suspense and a "dark" "edgy" tone, but I'm pretty sick of that sort of thing. Although the show touches on serious subjects like slavery and environmental issues, and there are definitely dramatic, emotional scenes in the episodes, so far (I'm up to episode 9) things are basically lighthearted. I'm hoping for a satisfyingly happy ending.<br /><br />Flash may not be terribly original, but is anything anymore? At times I'm reminded of other sci-fi shows like Smallville (character dynamics such as Ming's twisted tough love approach to his daughter, which is reminiscent of Lionel and Lex Luthor...and the fact that Dale is a bit of a cross between Lois Lane and Lana Lang, as a smart reporter/hometown girl next door/long-time love), but honestly, Smallville has become unwatchable and offensive in many ways. I'd rather watch Flash right now. Those who miss the earlier, lighter, more fun-for-the-whole-family seasons of shows like Smallville or Buffy, should check this out.<br /><br />It's nice to find something on TV these days with relatively strong female role models (in contrast to the poorly written and constantly exploited females on Smallville), an entirely likable cast (especially Karen Clich√© who's kick-ass cool and does a great job with her comedic moments as an alien adjusting to Earth), engaging characters/story lines, etc. Flash also shows some restraint regarding sexually suggestive stuff that would largely sail over kids' heads, and violence that isn't too disturbing - how refreshing that they kept a story that was originally innocent & intended for children...suitable for children. (Smallville again suffers by comparison there). And, again, humorous banter and an overall fun vibe should not be undervalued! <br /><br />I only hope the writers & producers of Flash Gordon don't make too many changes, trying to please those who have written negative reviews. I truly don't understand the harsh criticism I've read about this entertaining show.<br /><br />P.S. Those who are disappointed because this Flash differs from previous incarnations of their childhood, should keep in mind that those other versions differed as well, from each other and from the original comics. If the world can accept "modernized re-imaginings" of classics by Shakespeare, Jane Austen, L. Frank Baum, etc, I think we should be able to handle a new kind of Flash Gordon. As long as the show stays true to it's own established universe/concept/characters, I won't complain.
