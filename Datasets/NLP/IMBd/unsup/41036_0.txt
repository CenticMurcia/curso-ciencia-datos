I saw this on cable and thank god i did. I was a male prostitute when i was young and this movie is so way off that i can't believe someone even thought of making it. First off women NEVER hire male prostitutes. It just does not happen except in rare occasions and only from ads in magazines never ever ever off the streets. Whoever thought that girls pick up guys off the street was dreaming. Guys turn tricks for other guys PERIOD!!! Ok having said that it would not be quite so horrible if the acting by the lead was good, but its not its awful and unrealistic. Maybe they should have played this like a fantasy cuz then maybe it would have at least been somewhat entertaining but the only characters who is even worth watching is the gay guy and Daryl Hanna and thats it. If you have to watch a movie about male hustlers then watch "my own private Idaho" or maybe "johns" which is not great but a much much better movie than this piece of crap. I gave this movie 2 stars for the gay dude and Daryl Hanna but other than that save your time and money and don't watch this.
