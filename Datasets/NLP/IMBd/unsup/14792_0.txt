WOW<br /><br />Nikhil Advani, Karan Johar and the amazing cast of this movie have come together to make only the second flawless Bollywood movie of this generation.<br /><br />What can I saw about Shah Rukh Khan, an actor who even today manages to mesmerise and captivate his audience. In the majority of his movies, even I (a die-hard) find that he over-acts, but in this movie, his is at the pinnacle of his craft. His control is admirable, and I fell in love with him all over again. <br /><br />Saif Ali Khan, who started his career as a callow youngster shows that he has finally come of age, and his heartbreaking performance in this movie is astoundingly mature.<br /><br />Preity Zinta is wholly believable as the woman they both fall in love with-- I almost fell in love with her myself (except my heart belongs to SRK!!)<br /><br />The supporting cast, full of stars in their own right, gave exquisitely balanced performances, with not a gesture or moment of screen time wasted.<br /><br />Nikhil Advani, I salute you. You have managed to create what I didn't think was possible in todays world-- a Bollywood film that makes you laugh, cry, feel sad and yet happy at the same time, and also doesn't make you ashamed to take your non-indian friends to. The only other movie that has accomplished that recently was DDLJ (and even that had one scene too far).<br /><br />The songs, which were disappointing on first listen, fit into the film so well that I will cry every time I hear them. They now make perfect sense (in the same way that the songs of KKHH also improved after watching the movie)<br /><br />The look of the film, the humour, the choreography, the set direction, the cinematography, the everything of this movie are outstanding.<br /><br />In years to come, I will watch this movie with my kids (I hope), and hope that they will learn what I have today-- that the Bollywood movie is not dead, indeed it is alive and kicking, and Kal Ho Naa Ho, this movie will be a perfect monument to 2003 Bollywood cinema.<br /><br />Anyone who doesn't like this movie must truly have a heart of stone.<br /><br />WOW
