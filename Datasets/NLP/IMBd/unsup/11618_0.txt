Way too much objectionable language is the only fault of this otherwise extremely-entertaining film that is justifiably popular.<br /><br />Humor is what makes this "crime film" stand out as tough guys Robert De Niro, Joe Pantoliano, John Ashton, Dennis Farina and others provide a lot of laughs as not-so-tough guy Charles Grodin is escorted from New York to Los Angeles to face retribution from a mob boss.<br /><br />The dialog between Grodin and his bounty hunter captive De Niro, is terrific all the way through. The soundtrack, featuring the guitar of Ry Cooder, also is outstanding and adds to the fun of this film.<br /><br />The capper to this likable story is the satisfying ending, which almost everyone seems to like.
