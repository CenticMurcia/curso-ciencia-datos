The Mole People features John Agar endlessly talking about things that he seems to think he knows about. While on a dig in the far east, Agar and Mr. Cleaver discover a reference to a lost city. Together, with a rather heavy set man called LaFarge, meaning Load, they set off and discover a race of albinos living under the mountain. These albinos are ruled by a king who looks like a hood ornament and Alfred the Butler of TV's Batman fame. Agar meets a marked one, and the two of them sort of fall in love. She plays the lute and he waxes philosophical. In the end, they insight an uprising by the mole people, bringing down this ancient, but really dumb, civilization. Agar's love interest is killed when she decides to run under a large stone pillar that is falling. Thankfully, the end.
