One can't help thinking director Foley is a director without much in the way of confidence himself . A sure sign of someone knowing they lack confidence in day to day life is for them to disguise this by putting up a loud front thereby hiding whatever inadequacies they feel they may have . Perhaps the director feels the world may have something against him because he once directed the long forgotten Madonna star vehicle WHO'S THAT GIRL ? Possibly I don't know , but he directs CONFIDENCE in an entirely fast paced way , rather like " MTV Meets The Coen Brothers " which may give audience members a potential headache<br /><br />Despite the directing which comes across as garish and shallow we're left with a movie that is let down by the script and one can't help thinking the screenplay is what caused the director to look for Scorsese's CASINO for inspiration . No one can dispute the dialogue is foul mouthed , perhaps too much so but are the characters , situations and dialogue quirky or is everything unconvincing ? Considering I only gave this movie four out of ten it's not too difficult to understand what I thought of it . One of the worst movies that has starred Hoffman
