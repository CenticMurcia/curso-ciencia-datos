This movie was not only scary, but well executed. BIll Cobbs, Alex Feldman, and Jason Scott Campbell's chemistry added to making the whole story truly believable. Subtle hints throughout the movie explain the outcome of the movie, but of course, many of them are missed until you go back and think about what has happened. There were also some comedic scenes, such as in the bar, and the cocky behavior of Alex, (one of the medical students), as well as the conversations among the bar patrons, that will make you chuckle. The patrons in the sleepy little town where the movie was filmed, seems to be stuck in the seventies... or perhaps, its just small town America. The two college students are certainly a rude awakening to what America has become. A society with its main focus on money, success and greed. You will be taken by surprise as the events of this movie unfold. The story is well crafted and intriguing. Bill Cobbs is at his best!
