When I first watched this movie, me, a cousin and an uncle who was our age, were a sort of trio! That alone would be special, but, besides that me and my cousin used to share our dreams and try to interpret them and believed we could learn things through dreams!!<br /><br />This movie is magical for me, because it reminds me of a time in my life when I used to believe in dreams, imagination and friendship. I was more like Ethan's character, and my cousin was Phoenix's and my uncle was just like the other little boy! Coincidences...<br /><br />It is in my heart even if I grow up and loose part of the capacity to fly!!<br /><br />STRONGLY ADVISE YOU TO SEE IT!!
