Bordello Of Blood is a somewhat disappointing follow up to the previous (and far superior) Tales From The Crypt feature "Demon Knight". While it retains the possibly even more stupid and irritating this time around Cryptkeeper mini sections at the beginning and end of the story it lacks Demon Knight's best attribute, a sharp, quality script, and a fun thrilling main story, which more than made up for having to endure the noxious Cryptkeeper last time out. Thats not to say that Bordello Of Blood is all bad, it's just nowhere near as good or as much fun as Demon Knight was.<br /><br />However Bordello Of Blood does have a few things going for it. A decent, suitably schlocky story premise (by Bob Gale and Robert Zemeckis no less), a hip attitude and a sense of camp fun about the whole proceedings, and most important of all actor Dennis Miller, for it is he and his great laid back performance that saves this film from sinking into mediocrity altogether.<br /><br />Dennis Miller is great fun as private eye Rafe Guttman, and he really does carry the film. The other performances range from good (Erika Eleniak) to bizarre (Chris Sarandon) to delightfully fun (Aubrey Morris) to frighteningly wooden (Angie Everhart and Corey Feldman). Then there's the direction.<br /><br />While Gilbert Adler's direction is technically fine, if at times a little too unrestrained, it sadly lacks any real sense of energy or character, and because of this the film just never feels quite right. While it could have been a very good fun little schlock fest instead it doesn't seem to quite know what it wants to be, and as such comes out as very uneven in tone, throwing the film off balance and not letting you just enjoy it for what it is (or should be), simple fun schlock horror.<br /><br />Despite it's problems Bordello Of Blood still manages to be an enjoyable tongue in cheek piece of hokum for lovers of the genre, but it's unlikely to convert anyone else, and isn't a patch on the first Crypt film. In spite of itself it did manage to hold my attention and mostly entertain during it's relatively short length, mainly due to the afore mentioned great performance of Dennis Miller, but it still should have delivered more than it manages to. Overall Bordello Of Blood manages to be suitably campy, undemanding fun but little more.<br /><br />One man's opinion. 7/10
