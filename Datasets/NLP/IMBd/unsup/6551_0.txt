I caught this on TV one day not knowing what it was called or who made it. The film hypnotized me with beautiful photo, unhurried pace and a charismatic main character - Sam Marlowe, played to perfection by John Forsythe.<br /><br />Then I picked up a paper and found out that it was made by Hitchcock. It surprised me because TTWH is lacking in suspense but rich in humor, romance and mystique. Good performances by everyone involved. The characters seem like real people who have their lives interrupted by a small inconvenience (the corpse).<br /><br />The film is completely original and I can't wait to see it again.
