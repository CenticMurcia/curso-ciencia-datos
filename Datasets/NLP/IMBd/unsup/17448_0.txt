I loved this episode. It was a complete nail biter, and edge of your seat kinda deal. From the re appearance of Gordon, who by the way in my eyes is a fantastic villain, to the apparent disappearance of Ava...it was fantastic! Jensen Ackles performances were again spot on. From his first fight with Gordon, to the soul splitting 'death of SAM', he was brilliant. Just the right amount of action and mystery to make it a fantastic episode! Kudos to the writers, and of course to the brilliance of Kripke. Ava was a brilliant character, just the right amount of angsty 'why me' behaviour, coupled with a bubbly personality to make a refreshing addition to the episode. All in all a FANTASTIC piece of work, and one of my favourite episodes... and while I'm here can i just add how much i loved that blood splatter on the camera when SAM blew up :D Xsarahx
