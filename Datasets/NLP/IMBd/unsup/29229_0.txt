Aided by saloon owner Marlene Dietrich, John Wayne and his cantankerous partner Harry Carey Sr. battle claim jumping of the legal variety, perpetrated by villainous bureaucrat Randolph Scott.<br /><br />A sometimes painfully slow first half, partially due to Dietrich's role being stretched out to fit her top-billed status, is redeemed by an engrossing and exciting second half, including a rousing climax at Wayne and Carey's mine and a helluva great fist-fight between the Duke and Scott.<br /><br />Harry Carey easily gives the best performance of the film. He and his rifle steal every scene they're in!
