One of the best Asian horror remake<br /><br />I was fortunate enough to view the film during the Cannes Film Festival. And it was received by the critics and audiences with open arms. The original film, "Sigaw", was the first Filipino horror for a long time to be very atmospheric.<br /><br />Directed by the original film's director, Yam Laranas, "The Echo" is a very fine and atmospheric film like the original. The changes from the original was obvious and was probably done to expand the character histories.<br /><br />Delivering very frightening chills, "The Echo" is a step up to your average Asian horror remake.
