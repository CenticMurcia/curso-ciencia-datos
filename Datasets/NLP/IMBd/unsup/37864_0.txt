For the major part Assassination of Trotsky moves with a very slow pace and makes the movie even boring from time to time. Some scenes are over dramatized and creates an uneven tempo. Richard Burton:s character Leon Trotsky is minimized an old man walking around his villa speaking monologues, not enough to save the movie. Alain Delon acts Frank Jacson, the assassin, with bad judgment. The character is overplayed and not convincing. You even have trouble hearing what the man says when English not is his native tung! The story is very interesting and with burton in the lead one suspect that Assassination of Trotsky is a good film. Sadly this is not the case and the movie cannot be recommended. This is not a bad film but it suffers to much from an uneven tempo, bad direction and bad acting. It adds up to 3/10
