I love watching horrible movies in general. From Shaq to Manos to ninja movies, I almost always cry from laughter.<br /><br />Not this time.<br /><br />This movie was not even close to funny bad, it was just painful. It was boring, except for the few fighting scenes, and the plot (whatever there was of it) made NO sense. The climax is utterly inexplicable, and I wouldn't mind if someone could explain exactly what it was all about.<br /><br />The scenes showing ridiculous ninja powers (eg, flight and toxic barf) are hilarious, but far too few to save this movie. I'll never watch it again.
