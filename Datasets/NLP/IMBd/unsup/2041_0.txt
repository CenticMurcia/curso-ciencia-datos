Directed by Corey Yuen (The Legend) and starring Qi Shu (The Transporter) as the deadly assassin Lynn, a.k.a. Computer Angel; Vicki Zhao (Shaolin Soccer) as Lynn's spunky younger sister Sue; Karen Mok (Shaolin Soccer) as Hong Yat Hong, the ambitious cop set on catching the two; and the oh-so-dreamy Seung-heon Song as Yen, Lynn's doe-eyed love interest.<br /><br />The story starts off with a beautifully shot and choreographed action sequence where Lynn gets into a crime lord's uber-command center and kicks some major butt in a flurry of glass shards as "Close To You" by The Carpenters plays in the background.<br /><br />At first I thought Lynn was our star, the dark assassin seeking love/redemption. Then it seemed as though Hong Yat Hong may have been our main character, the woman-cop who knows only that these two are hired killers whom she must catch. Then the story focuses on Sue and her inner-angst/possible sexuality issues. It feels like it may have been a flaw on the writer/director's side that there was no clear protagonist, which would have been better for a film like this, but it still worked well.<br /><br />The movie had amazing action scenes, a great sister on sister bubble bath battle, and some really fun characters. The romantic scenes between Lynn and Yen are painfully entertaining and at times the film's score sounds like it comes off of a music library CD, but even at its worst So Close is unendingly endearing.<br /><br />In the end it felt like a cross between Charlie's Angels (the movie) and those bad Chinese restaurant Karaoke videos. I definitely recommend this film to fans of cheesy action flicks or campy female leads.
