Lets be honest, this film is appalling. This was the first film my brother and sister ever watched and to be frank, what an awful introduction to cinema. The film goes along without you feeling any empathy with the characters and boredom at the lack of anything exciting happening. I know it is a children's movie but please instead of including a darker element lets have some entertainment and fun. It just didn't work, it would have been better as just an animation but unfortunately the director wanted to make it a 'grown-up' kids film, not a great idea. Next time just make something funny, entertaining and without an annoying pig which no-one really cares about. Instead of this go and buy something like Lion King or Beauty and the Beast which CAN incorporate excitement and emotive sequences.
