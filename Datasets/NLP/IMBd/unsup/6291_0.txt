There is little denying that "Fear Her" is a bad egg - it is insignificant in the series, a bit laughable, and not exactly dark or terrifying. But saying that, it was interesting. It had me hooked - I've always loved the premise of drawings coming to life, and this episode uses that to good advantage. The Doctor and Rose finally have some purpose in the story this time round, and the idea to have this set in 2012 on the dawn of the Olympics is another stroke of genius. Of course, something like this would never happen then, but it was immensely riveting to see thousands of people disappear because of a drawing on some kid's wall. The next thing - she was drawing the Earth on her wall - need I say any more? I personally found this riveting because it was a fun ride, and nowhere near as stupid or pathetic as "Love and Monsters". The ending was suitably thrilling and strange - the Doctor once again saves the day, though, but the last words of this episode leave us waiting for the conclusion of this series which promises to be suitably dark and mysterious. Whereas "Love and Monsters" was just boring, "Fear Her" was an interesting episode that at least inspired me to keep watching - no naked monsters chasing people through the streets and no badly-written romance ensure this is a slice of Doctor Who that will prove fun. 7/10
