"The Bed Sitting Room" is hard to describe to the average viewer. It reminded me of a Monty Python film with set pieces from a Salvador Dali painting. Many have compared the film to the work of director Alejandro Jodorowsky, which is probably the best way to describe the film's surrealism. Because of all the rubble and junk-piles turned into crazed surrealist imagery, It's also been compared to "The Cremaster Cycle". But I feel "the Bed Sitting Room" is much more enjoyable than the pretentious, self referential cremaster series. Did I mention how funny the film is? The story concerns a nuclear war that happened so fast, that hardly anyone remembers it. There is a dozen or so survivors. Because of all the radiation, one man is convinced he'll turn into a bedroom. A young girl is 18 months pregnant. Her mother turns into a dresser and her father a parrot, all due to radiation. Weird Huh? And we can't forget Mrs. Ethel Shroake, the survivor that's the closest distant relative to a now deceased queen of England. This film is utter lunacy and gets better with every viewing. The humor in the film is very dry. The more you think about the jokes, you realize just how ridiculous and funny it really is. So if your looking for an obscure, surreal end of the world wasteland, this is a film for you. I personally loved this film . Its wit and originality are in a category of its own. It's as if Monty Python and Jodorowsky teamed up to make a movie. "Long Live Mrs. Ethel Shroake!!!"
