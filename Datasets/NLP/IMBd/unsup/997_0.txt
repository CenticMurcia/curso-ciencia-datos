I saw this in Pittsburgh PA in a small theater there. This movie was a lot of fun with tons of B movie stars and references. A total blast from start to finish with everything you'd expect from a low budget movie. Brinke Stevens, Robert Z'Dar, Edwin Neal, and Tom Savini are especially good. This is by far the most fun I've had at the movies in years!
