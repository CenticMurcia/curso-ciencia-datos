I love westerns and I love Jeff Bridges. After seeing A Door in the Floor again I remain mystified as to why he doesn't have a shelf full of Oscars. That said, Bad Company is not a terrible movie but it surely isn't great. It is a stretch to call it uneven because it is evenly ordinary. It lacks the lyric quality of McCabe and Mrs. Miller or the iconic quality of The Searchers. As a matter of fact, it is not really comparable to any of the great westerns because it is inherently small and my bottom line is that to the extent that it is worth watching, it is because it was a sincere effort but that is the best I can do and it is faint praise indeed. I don't think that it is a neglected masterpiece but think it is neglected precisely because it is not a masterpiece.
