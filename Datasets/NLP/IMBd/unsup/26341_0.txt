A really touching character driven roadmovie, with excellent performances by the two main characters (especially the youngest one).<br /><br />I can honestly say that this is one of my top five favourite movies. Too bad I only got the chance to see it once. If you get the chance, don't miss it! This movie will stay with you for days after seeing it. Nevermind all the meaningless hollywood flicks, THIS is what movies are all about.
