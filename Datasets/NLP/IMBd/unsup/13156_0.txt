the lost room kept me at the edge of my seat. i arranged my schedule around it. this is something i don,t normally do. is that all there is? are you making a movie or a series? i wanted more i was left with many unanswered questions. How did the human object come into existence? was he a physicist who specialized in time and space? Is he from an alternate universe? did he really die or did he return to his place of origin when he died? at his death did he go into another dimension? will the human objects replacement collect all the objects? will the replacement be hounded down? etc.... thank you for those entertaining hours give me more.
