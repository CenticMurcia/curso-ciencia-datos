The fifth pairing of Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner is still good and features many gags that work, including a tiger trap, a pop-up steel wall, a motorcycle, a unfateful encounter with a train (Stop in the name of humanity), and a box of Acme-brand leg-building vitamins. I love the little gag of the coyote eating a fly in the beginning as well. All these cartoons make me so very happy for some unknown reason. This animated short can be seen on Disc 2 of the Looney Tunes Golden Collection Volume 2. It also features an optional commentary by Greg Ford.<br /><br />My Grade: A
