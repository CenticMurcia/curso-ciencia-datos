i don't understand why people just don't talk about this movie or anything...it's one of the best movies i've seen recently. i'm in love with kathleen turner cos she's such a great actress, and the other people did a pretty good job in the acting department as well. this movie is so great considering how john waters' films have kinda gone downhill recently. cry-baby & hairspray were a little too tame & lame for me. i want trash!!! i want more killing! i want more leg of lamb! and i want more cussing! that's why i love john waters, and hopefully he'll read this and create the most ugliest movie yet and i'll be in love with him more...
