I've read all the other comments about this variety program which is a hodge-podge of material selected with no apparent theme in mind other than comedy, and if you like vintage comedy, that's good enough for some of us. When TV was in it's infancy, material like this was readily available on the Ed Sullivan show, the Jackie Gleason show, and many other classic programs, and for those of us who grew up watching TV in an era when they would only broadcast for about 12 hours per day because there was not enough material available to fill an entire 24-hour schedule, then you will be very happy to see this type of stuff once again. The heritage of all the episodes is pure vaudeville, and though I'm not that old, don't forget that vaudeville entertained people for many more years than our modern TV era. So, I think all the other comments come from people who don't appreciate the comedic history of this delightful montage. If you like antiques, watch it and enjoy!
