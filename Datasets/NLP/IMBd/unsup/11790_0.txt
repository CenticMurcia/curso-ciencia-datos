This film from first time writer/director Jonathan Teplitzky is an ambitious venture and one that succeeds very well.<br /><br />It follows the trials and tribulations of a "one night stand" that goes that little bit further.<br /><br />Supurb acting from lead actors David Wenham and Susie Porter as well as a slick and funny script from Teplitzky make this a brilliant film. It leaves the audience in no doubt as to what is, indeed, Better Than Sex.
