I don't know if the previous comment was made by the director of this awful film but in fact it is just a B series. Poor actor with kind of acceptable special effects are making this production watchable but the whole edit is not good enough to keep you under pressure, humor is too low and the great lines of the story are predictable. <br /><br />This movie isn't worth the location. If you have taken the sci-fi channel, watch Battlestar Galactica, Dresden Files, Eureka and other good series but forget about this rubbish son of a bitch basilisk.<br /><br />In fact I am really angry because there was a very good comment here but in fact it's someone who hasn't the same taste as me, and i'm displeased that he said it's the better mini-series or film made by Sci-fi.<br /><br />Go get a porno it's better And go get your wasting time in your toilets.
