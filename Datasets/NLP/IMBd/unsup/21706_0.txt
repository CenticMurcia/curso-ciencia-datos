My husband and I have been waiting and watching for this film for three-four years now. It was OUTSTANDING. My husband was contacted by some film people who knew someone who knew someone who knew him. He lent them a Cheyenne-style war shirt for the film, and other small items and gave some suggestions - we never heard back from the film people after they returned the shirt, so we always wondered what had happened to it. Now we know, and are we EVER impressed. Unfortunately, we didn't hear about the film until Monday, so we missed the first part, and can't wait to get our own copy so we can see part one to see if his shirt made it into the film (would have been the beginning we guess!)<br /><br />I agree whole-heartedly with they viewer who saw it at UCLA. It's about time. My husband portrays the historical lifestyle of the Potowatomi in Illinois, which is where his research and study took him, so he couldn't speak to the film guys' questions about more western nations, but we were thrilled to see so many people on film sharing the stories, and teaching. This is just so very good. Done so well. The other viewer was right - this was meant for the big screen. I guess it's a step in the right direction, but walk boldly, man! "Smoke Signals" was another really good one - it was a "sleeper" to me - I found it in the video store and took a chance, but it's one of my favorite all-time movies. I laughed, I cried - I really liked the characters in the movie, just like this one - good storytelling.<br /><br />DreamKeeper needs to be followed by more strong film! Totally awesome!
