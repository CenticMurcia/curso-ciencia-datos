The film opens with four women waking up in a room, they have no memory of their lives before nor do they know where they are. The women show "character" immediately - there's the emotional one, the tough one, the sensitive one and the heroine. The women are subjected to various tests, which are conducted by a callous scientist and his assistants who talk like robots and look like they belong rather to a street rave. The action is like slime - sticky and drags on forever. The last quarter of the film, however, sees a change of pace and the viewer is poured over with information that literally comes out of the blue and quite frankly makes no sense.<br /><br />The whole feel of "Bane" is bizarre - it tried to be too original and ended up making a mess out of itself. It's not a least bit interesting to watch either, it tries to be gory, psychological and supernatural all at the same time and fails miserably in all genres.
