I've seen the movie and I absolutely loved it. The chemistry between Jason and Virginia was amazing. The friction between Lainie and Virginia was intense and interesting. The writing was very well done and the setting was unbelievably beautiful. I can honestly say that would've been an extremely hard choice to make,especially with Jason Momoa being my alternative. <br /><br />Don't get me wrong,I'm all for the sanctity of marriage, but to escape an unfulfilled life with a disrespectful, brat of a daughter and end up in paradise with the hottest Hawaiian on the island. That might make a woman stop and reconsider her options. I think this is one of lifetime's greatest movies yet.
