I love watching this movie because it's just so funny. Sharukh Khan was fantastic in the film and so was Jhonny Lever.My favourite part in the film is when Sharukh Khan lies to Twinkle Khanna about being blind and Sharukh Khan and Jhonny Lever and they partners pretend that Sharukh Khans house is the hospital.I also enjoyed the fighting parts because it was well put together. Sharukh Khan was good at playing the Baadshah and the comedian. Sharukh Khan and Twinkle Khanna were good working together.Shahrukh Khan is a detective and while he is doing his detective work he falls in love with Twinkle Khanna. Amrish Puri was a good villain in this film as he is in nearly all of his villain movies.
