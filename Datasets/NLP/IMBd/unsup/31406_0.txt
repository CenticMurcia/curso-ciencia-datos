I have always marveled at the accounts of the "obscenity" trials like Larry Flynt's in the days of old. What a quaint concept, that art or ideas can be so offensive and harmful that they should be banned. I wouldn't ban this movie, or any other. But the pure hatefulness of the presentation of violence in this this film is reason enough to keep the word "obscene" in our language.
