I was subjected to this at a party recently and honestly, I can say nothing good about it. The animation was awful, the storyline (such as it was) was incomprehensible. The voice acting was passable, but hardly makes up for how horrible the rest of this cartoon was. After a short time, maybe five or ten minutes, of having this trash inflicted on me, I managed to politely excuse myself and get some chips. How anyone above the age of ten can be so enamored with this remains a mystery to me. But, from what I can see, fans of this genre are rabid enough that poor animation and incomprehensibility make no difference to them, so one negative review equally will make no difference.<br /><br />On the other hand, if you like GOOD animation, steer clear of this and watch some classic Bugs Bunny instead.<br /><br />0/5 stars.
