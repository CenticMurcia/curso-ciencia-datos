Absolutely devoid of any suspense, terror, or drama of any kind, this miserable "horror" film is completely incoherent. The lighting is so poor it's difficult to see what's happening. The setting (an old house in the woods) is not milked for any significant mood or atmosphere. Most of the actresses are indistinguishable from one another. The underlying theme of sexual violence and degredation is disgusting. And the sight of the masked "killer" on ice skates, doing laps around a frozen pond, is sure to send you into a fit of hysterics. By far one of the worst horror films of the early 80s, and believe me, I've seen most of 'em. 1/10.
