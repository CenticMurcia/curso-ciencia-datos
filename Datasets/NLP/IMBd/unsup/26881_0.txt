This is a b&w and very low budget film made by one of the actors, Rusty Nails, and while it has its moments, it's merely OK. Contaminated drinking water manages to postpone a class field trip by turning NJ teens into zit-heads. They are then attracted to greasy food and (of course) chocolate, and they don't eat it, they rub it on the affected area. Lots of zit bursting and pus flowing, if you like that sort of thing. Problem is though, the prosthetic zits are bald-head wigs, sort of, and there isn't one of the people involved where you can't clearly see that. Anyway, the army gets involved, and they're a bumbling lot, of course, just like in real life, and they are out to stop the teens from reaching Mershey, PA, which is of course the place where they make Mershey chocolate bars. It's also George Romero country, and there are more than a few scenes here that resemble bits of Night of the Living Dead. This is somewhat amusing and disgusting, and would have been better had the makeup effects not been so obvious. I'm not sure what happens toward the end but I think perhaps Clearasil figured in somewhere. A decent attempt, but falls a bit short of the mark. 7 out of 10.
