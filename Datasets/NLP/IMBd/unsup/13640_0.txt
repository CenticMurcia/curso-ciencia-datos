I'll admit that I didn't know of this films existence until a critically acclaimed movie critic went on a rant against it(hint: the same critic that gave Speed 2 a thumbs up). That was enough to make me go out and get it. Drop Squad will not be accepted by the keepers of Status Quo and their token friends but it will most likely be accepted by those that can see past their nose.<br /><br />The story is simple enough: the Drop Squad(Drop is an acronym for Deprogramming and Restoration Of Pride) is group that kidnap ignorant sellout blacks and force them to reconnect with their culture while getting them to realize what they're doing to their people is wrong. Rocky Seavers(Vondie Curtis-Hall) is the leader and has questions about some of the methods that the Drop Squad use on sellouts and begins to bump heads with one of his comrades, Garvey(Ving Rhames) about the methods used. They end up kidnapping corporate clown by the name of Bruford Jamison(Eriq La Salle). From then on Bruford gets flashbacks on all the times he sold out and recalls a crucial moment when he screwed over his own brother Flip(Afemo Omilami)by refusing to come help him out when he tried to get a job at his workplace. The acting is great. Eriq La Salle, Vondie Curtis-Hall and Ving Rhames all turn in some good performances. I like the message of the movie and felt that the scene where Flip confronts Bruford was a touching scene as well as the scene where Rocky talks to Bruford. Closing comments: Drop Squad is a necessary requirement for everybody thats into movies with substance. If the Drop Squad really did exist then I'm glad they did but if they didn't I couldn't be more disappointed especially since we need them now more than ever! Two Thumbs Way Up.
