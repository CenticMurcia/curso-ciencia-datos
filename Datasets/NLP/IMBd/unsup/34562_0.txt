One of the worst movies ever made. My friends and I walked out after an hour, so maybe it got better...but I doubt it. The humor is stupid and banal, but I knew that going in. What I didn't know is that no one in the cast would have any sense of comic timing, the production values would be close to nil, and that I wouldn't laugh. Ever.<br /><br />The story idea (taking a sweet Mormon kid from Utah and throwing him in the middle of the porn industry) could have turned into a really funny movie, but the script is dull and the performances are duller. This isn't even worth a rental. Bleah.
