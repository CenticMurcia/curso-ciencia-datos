One of the funniest shorts. Great cameos - Lou Diamond Phillips is hysterical as is Scott Thompson of "Kids in the Hall". It's not for the faint of heart, definitely. But if you like really edgy comedy, then you'll dig this. Those of you (like me) who are Ron Jeremy fans will love the showdown scene between Ron and Scott. And the final scene will literally blow your mind! I'm still laughing about it! Dead on satire of the porn industry. For an eight minute short you get more bang for your buck than most features.<br /><br />Truly original!!!
