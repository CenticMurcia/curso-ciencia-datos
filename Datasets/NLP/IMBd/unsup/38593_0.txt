What the hell is going on in this movie? Apparently, someone forgot that there can only be one. Both versions, theatrical and "renegade", suck. Now, the renegade version does suck slightly less. The other world plot line is abandoned, thank God, but the main problem is still there. You have to assume that God or whatever force has some rule over this world and you can't just have someone get "the prize" if they aren't "the one". So what the hell was supposed to have happened at the end of the first film? False alarm? The improved Renegade version has the new immortals coming from the future. Yay, I care. The only thing worth watching is Michael Ironside. No one does wide eyed crazy quite like him and this is his field day.
