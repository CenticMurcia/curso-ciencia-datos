Sayles makes an all-star cast film? Yes and no, because they were all unknowns when this was made. Still you can still see that Cusack was destined for bigger stuff. It takes a typical and historic American tale, but adds a bit of the Sayles influence. Silent heroes and put-upon men being exploited.<br /><br />Not quite a "Limbo" or "Lone Star", but this is still entertaining and involving stuff.<br /><br />And finally, what is it about baseball that produces such good films? A seemingly boring sport, but "Bull Durham", "A League Of Their Own" and especially "Field Of Dreams" are all decent films.
