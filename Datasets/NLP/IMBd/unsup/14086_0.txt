Okay, I simply had to see this since I saw it's "sequel" first (about two years ago), UNSEEN EVIL 2 (aka ALIEN 3000), and I immensely enjoyed it because it was truly one of the worst movies I had seen in a very long time. From it, I also learned that Tim Thomerson apparently starred in the "original". All this was reason enough for me to sit my a§§ down with this "original" epic tale of Alien Terror & Indian Mysticism.<br /><br />So how did it go down this time? On a bad movie-scale, this "original" is about twice less fun than the "sequel". Does that actually make it a better movie...? I have absolutely no idea...<br /><br />It's not even fun writing a user-comment for it (while the sequel was). We got annoying people running around in some woods, being chased and ripped to shreds by crappy CGI (make no mistake; it's not as fun as it sounds). But if that's your thing, then sure, go ahead and watch it. I'll always be willing to give retarded rubbish like this a peek, but I can only take so much of it.<br /><br />I'll be generous and give it one point for what happens to Tim Thomerson. Didn't see that one coming. I guess the producers realized they were spending too much money hiring him, so they just decided on the spot to write him out of the script.<br /><br />By the way, if you happen to love UNSEEN EVIL, then go watch DEMONICUS (2001). You'll have a blast. It's even from the same director (Jay Woelfel) and its more or less the same movie, only this time with a possessed idiot running around in a plastic Roman-times inspired body-armour, slashing people in the woods. Have fun.
