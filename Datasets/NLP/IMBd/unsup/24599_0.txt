Shoot em Up is the type of film that under normal circumstances, I wouldn't give the time of day. Its a brainless, action saturated spectacle, filled with wall to wall shootings and over the top action sequences not often seen outside of a Quentin Tarantino picture.<br /><br />But the fact it stars Clive Owen and Paul Giamatti, two of the world's most underrated actors was enough to convince me to check out the film when it was released to DVD. And thanks to the star power of these two, and the imaginative, impressively mounted direction from Michael Davis, Shoot em Up emerges as quite a delight.<br /><br />It moves like an Olympic runner on acid, it has a surprising sense of humour, and although it never once takes itself seriously, the film achieves a remarkable consistency and dignity thanks to the sheer enthusiasm of everybody present. Shoot em Up is the type of film that was as much fun for the filmmakers as it is for an audience.<br /><br />Ever since Clive Owen ascended to the A-list of Hollywood's leading men (something that took far too long in my opinion), he has often been pipped as the next actor to inherit the ongoing role of James Bond. Now of course with Daniel Craig sure to fill those shoes for a fair old bit, it doesn't seem very likely now that Owen will ever assume the role he was born to play. But with Shoot em Up, we get a bit of an idea of what he might have been like in the role.<br /><br />Shoot em Up does seem a concerted effort to be a deliberate spoof on James Bond. Larger than life villains. Beautiful women. Over the top stunts. And at the centre of it all...a rugged Clive Owen.<br /><br />The opening scene sets the jokey tone perfectly. The film opens with a closeup of Clive Owen's face. Hard. Tough. Someone you don't mess with. And then without skipping a beat, he begins munching on a carrot. The camera pulls back to reveal Clive sitting on a bench, waiting for the next bus. Sipping coffee...that he stirs with his carrot!<br /><br />Its very funny. I found myself laughing at the casual absurdity of it all. But before long, the action kicks into overdrive when a pregnant woman walking by is being pursued by a hit-man. Clive, known only as Mr Smith, decides to get involved.<br /><br />What follows is a blood-soaked, five minute action sequence that involves Smith delivering her baby while in the middle of a bloody shootout. It almost seems a direct parody of the previous year's Children of Men, when Clive Owen had to deliver a baby under similar circumstances. He even shoots off the umbilical cord!<br /><br />And that's just the beginning. What follows is a steady escalation of shootouts, burnouts and grossouts as Smith, and a hooker along for the ride must protect this baby from the dastardly Hertz (Giamatti).<br /><br />I'm not exactly sure why I have such affection for Shoot em Up. Maybe its because I'm such a huge fan of Clive Owen. The sheer peppy energy the production crew put into it. Or maybe its the way it blatantly disregards the rules of the game and dares you to laugh along with the action. Its gleefully irreverent, and all the better for it!<br /><br />Because the film clocks in at a neat 85 minutes, you don't get worn down by the kinesis of the action. It just glides by from one revved up action scene to the next. But it never takes its tongue out of its cheek.<br /><br />There's always tiny amusements to be found throughout. I like the different uses Smith puts his carrots to. They even become deadly weapons in his hands! Smith's the action man version of Bugs Bunny.<br /><br />But if Clive Owen is Bugs, then Paul Giamatti is Elmer Fudd. Hertz is not exactly a stretch for an actor of Giamatti's talents, but he doesn't coast by. In fact he looks like he's having more fun than Owen. He chews on the scenery with glorious reckless abandon. He gets plenty of pithy one-liners, and never shies away from delivering them, no matter how hammy they might sound:<br /><br />"Is he really this good or do we just really suck?"<br /><br />Clive Owen has always been one of my favourite actors and while Mr Smith doesn't match up to some of his best performances, Children of Men's Theo, Chancer's Stephen Crane, etc, he still launches into the role with his trademark professionalism.<br /><br />Smith may be a hard man but he's got a fine line in droll observations. Like how irked he gets when people don't indicate before changing lanes on the highway. And he's not above ramming into them with his car to prove his point! I also loved the scene when he chastises a mother for smacking her kid. Literally!<br /><br />The action scenes don't disappoint either. OK I never believed what I was seeing. But I really enjoyed the imagination (and sheer audacity) of the filmmakers. And if you've ever wanted to see a gunfight while in midair, you can in Shoot em Up!<br /><br />While watching the film, its probably not a good idea to think about such trivial things as plot! There's something about bone marrow transplants, corrupt senators and gun control lobbying. OK the plot's as thick as five short planks. But when a film is this much fun, who cares how brainless it is!<br /><br />Shoot em Up is the perfect film for a Friday night in. My advice would be to watch it with some friends, have a few beers and get really sloshed while you're at it. You'll have a hell of a great time!<br /><br />Don't miss the end credits either. Its the perfect lampoon of a Bond film intro scene. Only without the annoying theme song!
