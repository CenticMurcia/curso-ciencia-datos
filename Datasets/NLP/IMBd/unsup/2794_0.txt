ouch...that REALLY did hurt. and not because my belly was laughing so hard. the whole movie was was jampacked with the absolutely worst stuff German "comedy" has to offer. no joke, really no joke at all, was slightly funny. It's a complete emberassing mess. I hope this crap will be forbidden because of the possible damage it could do to your brain. I still have headaches. Please go and see "Gigli" or a Britney Spears movie, even this "gems" are 1000x better than this. It's no wonder at all when people think Germans can't be funny. This is the complete opposite of real funny, intelligent comedy. But maybe it was shot as some kind of project for mentally ill, pathetic unfunny comedians. You never know.<br /><br />Just sad.
