The different skits in this move, directed by the great Woody Allen, aren't all funny, but sometimes you have to go through stupid stuff to get to the funny material. The movie opens with a pretty funny skit, but after that, most of the other skits fall flat. Then the sketch with the mad scientist and the giant breast is pretty funny. But then... The last fifteen minutes of this movie are like a masterpiece of science fiction and comedy. The "What Happens During Ejaculation?" sketch is one of the best scenes in the history of film. The creativity, the actors, and the Woodster as the neurotic sperm, are great. The sperm acting like they're paratroopers preparing for battle is hilarious! The sets are spectacular and would set the ground work for the Woodster's next science fiction movie "Sleeper". I give the movie as a whole **1/2. The end of the film: ****!
