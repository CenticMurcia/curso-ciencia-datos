It's hard to believe now, in this age of loud, garish, obnoxious children's programming, that there once was a popular Saturday children's show that presented intelligent, sensitive, artistic films from around the world. That show was the CBS Children's Film Festival, and for several years in the '60s-'70s, hosts Kukla, Fran and Ollie offered some unforgettable viewing experiences to its young audience-- among the best were such titles as SKINNY AND FATTY, THE RED BALLOON, and this beautiful film from 1969. J.T. is the heartwrenching story of a lonely young boy growing up in an impoverished area of New York City whose life is changed by his discovery of an ailing stray cat. Befriending the animal gives J.T. a much-needed sense of purpose, and he attempts to nurse it back to health without help from the seemingly uncaring adults around him. It's an uncompromising film, one that doesn't try to sugarcoat the sadder events of the plot for its younger viewers, and no matter how old you are, you may find yourself in tears more than once while watching it. It does have an upbeat, hopeful ending, however, and with its holiday setting, it's the kind of film you should definitely add to your list of the best Christmas films ever made. If you remember this film from your childhood, you'll only be more moved seeing it again as an adult.<br /><br />It's shameful that this wonderful film is not readily available.<br /><br />This, and others from the CBS series, really need to be released on DVD as soon as possible. The kids of today don't know what they're missing.
