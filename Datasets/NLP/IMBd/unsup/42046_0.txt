This movie pretty much consists of a good idea but crappy development. Underfunded made this movie a big POS but anyway on with the review. This movie is about a group of story go-getters that want to get the biggest story of all and have pictures for proof of its existence. Their after a town called Acheron which apparently everyone died in. The town is out in the middle of nowhere and a few random people just appear out of nowhere and begin taking a role in the movie. But before you can even fathom how it ends let me tell you how it begins, a girl gets a gun to her head by some freako that said he saw this town, which they didn't even know what it was then. This movie pretty much isn't worth the 7.95 I paid for it, fund it better and make a new one with a real director and it might be worth your time.
