DD earlier made remarkable comedies though illogical yet funny<br /><br />This is a weird film by him, he tried the MASTI formula and brought an identical story of 3 guys who hav 3 wives and search for love outside even the characters are similar<br /><br />The comedy scenes are so cringe worthy, it looks like we are watching a stage play, the dialogues too are damn stage like<br /><br />The spiderman jokes are so bizarre while the Sanju angle and all other stuff is contrived<br /><br />The ending is the worst part of the film<br /><br />Direction by DD is bad Music is ordinary<br /><br />Camera-work is only saving grace<br /><br />Amongst actors Fardeen Khan and Zayed Khan shout too loud and act artificially mostly Sharman excels in his part, though this isn't a patch of his best works Amongst girls Esha overacts, Ayesha is just there and the rest are all bad Sanjay is plain horrible, he hams it up badly
