i can summarize this cinematic experience with one word: PAIN. every minute of this movie will make you feel like you crossed the yellow line, and by the end you'll be pleading for it to stop the intestination. despite a brilliant attempt to save the film by the rubber-faced Lincoln Kilpatrick, the acting is worse than atrocious. as far as the plot, words escape me. how exactly is paying to keep people locked up, fed, clothed, and boarded for 31 years less of a burden on society than having a second kid? the overhead that must be involved in running this prison is mind boggling. this is one of many questions you will ask yourself as you ride the roller-coaster of emotions this film provides. others may include: who decided the perfect soldier is a slow, clumsy, awkward animatronic plastic man with no lower jaw? if it is as easy to get to Mexico as driving through a single 15-foot fence that falls over in a stiff breeze, why did they bother to try to go through customs? why did it take until 1993 for humanity to discover that intestination is the most fantastic word ever invented? ultimately, this would have been a far better movie if it had had the benefit of being MST3Ked. As it is, you're better off going with the Mind Wipe.
