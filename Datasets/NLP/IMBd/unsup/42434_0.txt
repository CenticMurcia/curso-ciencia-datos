This is half review and half advice.<br /><br />The opening scene of this film is a sketch loosely known as "The Apartment." This was tremendous comedy.<br /><br />Once this sketch is over, the only advice i can give you is to push the STOP button. Beyond the opening scene, there is nothing even remotely funny about this film.<br /><br />I don't actually know anyone who has sat the whole way through this film and whenever it came up as a topic on conversation, "The Apartment" was the only thing people looked back on and laughed. In fact, everything after the apartment is not only unfunny; it's actually downright boring.<br /><br />Some people say that this has some connection (or is some sort of unofficial sequel) to Kentucky Fried Movie. Kentucky was one of the best comedies of its time, but Amazon does not even come close to reaching the same heights. Furthermore, in case you didn't know, Amazon had completely different writers. And it shows! Overall woeful, but if you happen to see it listed on some cable TV channel, I recommend tuning in for the Apartment sketch. Just have something else to watch once that sketch is over.
