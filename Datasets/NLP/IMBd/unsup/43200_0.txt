One thing I noticed about this cheese wedge was that it tried to look like it was taking place in North America even though it was made in Spain: 1- A portrait of George Washington hangs on the wall in the main setting. 2- A picture of Ronald Reagan hangs on the wall in the cabin where the hunter got killed. 3- A 'Sprite'sticker is stuck on the wall of the main setting. 4- One of the soon-to-be-victims comments that if the TV weren't out, at least they'd be able to watch 'Dallas' 5-There's one or two American flags hanging around. 6- The whole thing is basically a ripoff of E.T., an American film. There may be more,I'm not sure.I guess they wanted to make it look more American to attract a bigger audience. I don't think it happened. Thank goodness I watched this with MST3K.I don't think I would've made it without them. I'm sure I'd hate it without them.
