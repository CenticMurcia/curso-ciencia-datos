When I saw the trailer of "Fa Dou Daai Jin", I found it very attractive, with many special effects, wonderful landscapes and a nice cast and I decided to watch this movie on video. Unfortunately the screenplay is very silly and confused, never working as a comedy or an action movie. The acting is awful, especially Charlene Choi and her constant smile and Jaycee Chan. The name of Jackie Chan in the credits is only to attract his fans and sell the movie, since he has a very short participation of a few minutes. In the end, I found this boring movie a complete mess and waste of time. Directors Patrick Leung and Corey Yuen should know that a great budget and special effects alone do not make a good movie. My vote is two.<br /><br />Title (Brazil): "A Dinastia da Espada" ("The Dynasty of the Sword")
