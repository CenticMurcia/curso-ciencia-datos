The siblings Noah (Chris O'Neal) and Emma (Rhiannon Leigh Wryn) travel with their mother Jo (Joely Richardson) from Seattle to the family cottage in Whidbey Island to spend a couple of days while their workaholic father David Wilder (Timothy Hutton) is working. They find a box of toys from the future in the water and bring it home, and Emma finds a stuffed rabbit called Mimzy, and stones and a weird object, but they hide their findings from their parents. Mimzy talks telepathically to Emma and the siblings develop special abilities, increasing their intelligences to the level of genius. Their father becomes very proud when Noah presents a magnificent design in the fair of science and technology, and his teacher Larry White (Rainn Wilson) and his mystic wife Naomi Schwartz (Kathryn Hahn) become interested in the boy when he draws a mandala. When Noah accidentally assembles the objects and activates a powerful generator creating a blackout in the state, the FBI arrests the family trying to disclose the mystery. But Emma unravels the importance to send Mimzy back to the future.<br /><br />"The Last Mimzy" is a delightful and refreshing sci-fi story and a great family entertainment. Seven years old Rhiannon Leigh Wryn and thirteen years old Chris O'Neal are excellent in the lead roles of smart siblings but the adult support cast have many disappointing lines and attitudes. The screenplay discloses since the very beginning that Mimzy was sent from the future to save the human race, therefore there is no surprise or twist in the end. I did not have a great expectation in this adventure, and I had a wonderful surprise. My vote is eight.<br /><br />Title (Brazil): "Mimzy, A Chave do Universo" ("Mimzy, The Key of the Universe")
