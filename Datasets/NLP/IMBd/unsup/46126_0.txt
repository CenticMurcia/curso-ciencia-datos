Like so many other directors who peaked in the 1970s (Tobe Hooper, John Carpenter, Lucio Fulci, etc.), Dario Argento's recent work has been incredibly artless and boring. Last year's "Sleepless" was a disastrous attempt at returning to the giallos that made him famous, and "The Phantom of the Opera" (what is this, the MILLIONTH version?) is a murky, muddled, and indifferent stab at 'art.' Reviews that say this is Argento's worst film are not inaccurate--it's so dull I fast-forwarded through most of it, and I NEVER fast-forward through movies. The script is constantly pulling itself in different directions, the acting is downright terrible, the attempts at humor are awkward and unfunny, and the whole thing plays out with the look and feel of a soap opera. Through and through, this is terrible crap, with no redeeming value.<br /><br />Zero/10
