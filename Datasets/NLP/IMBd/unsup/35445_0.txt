"Luck of the Draw" is a very ordinary B-movie quality not-to-be-taken-seriously action/drama flick. The film includes a hero, a babe, a bunch of heavies, and a couple of T-men who are all involved in various schemes to get a pair of $100 counterfeit plates. The plot is somewhat clumsy and convoluted. The drama is substandard given the film's solid cast of perennial bad guys. The action is little more than a couple of ordinary shootouts. The sexsationalism is virtually nonexistent. The art and technicals are average. The film is not counter fit but is a passable small screen watch for crime flick buffs. (C-)
