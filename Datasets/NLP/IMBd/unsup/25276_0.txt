Sometime in the late 1960s or early 1970s, Lon Chaney Jr. made an appearance on the Tonight Show with Johnny Carson. During the interview, Johnny asked about the accuracy of this flick. Lon replied, (agreeing with Johnny),'close enough'. Johnny also asked about Lon Jrs. favorite film role. Lon asked,'what do you think'? Johnny replied,'I would think, Of Mice and Men'. Lon Jr. replied,'thank you'. He was getting along in years at this time. I would like to think that Of Mice and Men was his favorite role. My late father, who didn't particularly care for actors, loved movies. He said that Lon Jr. was FANTASTIC in the role of Lenny. My dad saw it as a first run, back in the days.
