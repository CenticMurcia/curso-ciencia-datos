I've seen other Olsen Twins movies, and most of them were ok, (It Takes Two) And one, 'Our Lips Are Sealed', was probably the best, so I had high hopes when I saw this on TV. This movie is an endless string of overused material.This movie is basically the same as 'Our Lips are Sealed', but with a LOT less charm. It's very predictable, no suprises anywhere to be found here.The only good thing that might come out of this mess is that it's a perfect movie to MST with you and your friends.
