glad to see here that I'm not the only one already hooked after just 3 episodes.<br /><br />I've tried to explain to people why they must watch it, but the only way they will understand is to watch it!<br /><br />Its hilarious: terrible acting, atrocious script, wobbly sets, appalling dubbing, and some very alarming wigs.<br /><br />And lots of slow motion (well, its hard to fill a half hour slot with story all the time)<br /><br />I'm looking forward to saying 'I told you so' to lots of people when they 'discover' this show in 6 months!
