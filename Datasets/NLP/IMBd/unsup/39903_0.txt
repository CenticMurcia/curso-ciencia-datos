I don't have much to say about this turkey except to watch for one incredible sequence with the terrorist contacting the control tower. The Tower gives the terrorist the usual talk about no negotiations. The terrorist decides he has to show that he means business. But how? His solution? Start tossing people out of the plane. An effective plan right? But that is not enough for this terrorist. He also wants to send a message to the control tower, to express his outrage at their non-cooperation.<br /><br />So, the terrorist opens the hatch and holds his selected victim inches away from doom. Then, as the plane flies over the airport, he carefully and judiciously calculates wind speed, vector problems, and trajectory so that when he drops the poor sap, the body will rip into the Control Tower like a missile. What a math wizard, he does this all on the fly without aid of a calculator.
