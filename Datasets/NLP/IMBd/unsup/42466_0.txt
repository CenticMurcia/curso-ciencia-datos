My friends invited me to go along and see this film when it came out. Drudgingly, I went along. I've never seen or heard of the original TV series, so i'm not going to be one of those who complains about that. This movie was simply a huge piece of garbage. I only remember actually laughing out loud once. The rest of the time I was watching my friends nearly fall out of their seats at the theatre and wondering why they are so stupid. This whole atrocity of a film was filled with nothing but the same repeatable jokes about "cha-ka" feeling Holly's breasts and other so called "jokes" by Ferrell which made me want to stop functioning. Will Ferrell is not by any means funny to me, he never has been, and I'm sure he never will be. The only person in the movie that I thought didn't use the same joke twice was the support, Will. A complete waste of my day. 1/10.
