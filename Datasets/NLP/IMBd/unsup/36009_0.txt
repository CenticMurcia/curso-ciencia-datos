Peter Hymans directed "2010" (1984) one of my favorite films over the years. I read many previous reviews here on this database so I went to rent it...I wish I hadn't! "Capricorn One" should be called "Crap/Corn 101" it's horribly dated with poor effects, lame characters and campy acting from people who should know better. It starts out promising enough, but goes awry and on and on with a terrible ending that leaves you wanting for something. "Capricorn One" is a relic of the late 70s' and should be viewed only as a historical oddity (ie: A pre-scandal O.J. Simpson, the then 'Mr. Barbra Striesand', Elliot Gould and the future 'Mr. Barbra Striesand', James Brolin together!).<br /><br />Final rating: 4/10 "A below average movie. It may have some wonderful elements but on the whole I cannot endorse it."
