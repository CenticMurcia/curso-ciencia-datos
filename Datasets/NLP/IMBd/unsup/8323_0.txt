I recently saw "The Attic Expeditions at DragonCon in Atlanta, Georgia.<br /><br />Fans of the horror genre should definitely check this film out. It's not a "blood and guts" film, but one that takes your inner fears and smacks you in the face with them.<br /><br />The movie is stylishly directed by first-time director, Jeremy Kasten. His work as an editor over the last several years gave him the eye that he needed to direct this film. I really liked his use of the camera as a character. Some directors tend to over-use it to try to make a point. Kasten takes you to that point, but pulls back before going over the top, a point that he deserves much credit for.<br /><br />The script is very clever to say the least. With bits of humor spread throughout (mostly delivered by Seth Green), the story pulls you in unlike most of the genre pieces that are floating around these days.<br /><br />With great performances by Green, Andras Jones, Jeffrey Combs, Ted Raimi, and a wonderful cameo by Alice Cooper, the film is exactly what the horror genre needs these days.
