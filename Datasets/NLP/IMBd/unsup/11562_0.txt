One of my all time favorite mystery movies. The acting, and locales were first rate. However I must correct an error by a previous poster. The rich women murdered was played by Lois Chiles. She is also great in this movie. One thing that still puzzles me is how Jane Birkin got second billing? Oh well. If you like star-studded, thought provoking mysteries,this one is for you.<br /><br />10 out of 10. Whodunit indeed!
