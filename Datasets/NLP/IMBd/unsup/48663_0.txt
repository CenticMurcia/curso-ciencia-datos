This is perhaps the driest performance I have ever seen from Robin Williams.I might have smiled and almost chuckled a time or two,but this film never once made me laugh.Humor that involves raw sewage just isn't very entertaining to me.As a matter of fact(and I say this with no pun intended),it stinks.I have always thought that Robin Williams is at his best when he is improving,and it just seems here that he was not given enough room to do this.It seems like he is going a little too much by the script.It may not be his worst film ever,but it certainly ranks closer to the bottom of the list than it does to the top of it.I recommend all movie goers steer clear of RV and take another road.
