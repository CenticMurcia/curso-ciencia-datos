This was a mildly entertaining film. Goldie Hawn is likeable as always, and it was good to see early roles of Wesley Snipes, Woody Harrelson and Mylketi Williamson. The football team is fittingly uncouth, as is to be expected, and Central High Principal Edwards is great. Watching it now, its probably not as good as I remembered it 13 years ago, but its still lots of fun as a time waster. The song during the final credits is probably one of the best parts though.
