This "documentary" supposedly reveals the "truth". That is that Bush planned 9/11. At first i believed it, but then i began to think, and realized, that it could not happen in a society like USA.<br /><br />The people who believe in this doc say that George Bush planned 9/11........ right (sarcasm)... An attack of that magnitude could not have been thought of by a man like Bush (i.e. low intelligence). And secondly: there would be to many leaks in the government. Just like now, with Iraq and Katrina - there have been so many leaks, just because of a hurricane and a war. And the idiots who believe in this film say that that the government covered it up..... THINK ABOUT IT. THAT IS TOTALLY IMPOSSIBLE. There would be too many leaks.<br /><br />If there are hundreds of leaks because of a hurricane Katrina and a war against a foreign and aggressive country like Iraq, why weren't there leaks about the biggest genocide in American History??????? The "humans" that believe in these documentaries cant answer that.<br /><br />The biggest genocide in American history could not be covered up like that: there would be too many people involved, too many people that on some level would know.<br /><br />only about 10 - 15 people is in Alex Jones documentaries - that does not talk good for it. No one wants to have any thing to do with it, because it is full of 造造造造.<br /><br />and secondly: if Bush and the shadow-government where willing to kill 2000 - 3000 people 9/11 because of power, why do they hesitate to kill Alex Jones all of us that know of the documentary, if the documentary is the truth????????????? THat is why i simply don't believe in them.<br /><br />when i saw peter Jacksons "forgotten silver", i knew how easy it is to foul people.<br /><br />Bush did not plan 9/11 - 9/11 happened because of incompetence, and that Al-quada simply outsmarted the US, the were totally unprepared.
