Sorry, but it's not...<br /><br />This is the WORST film ever made! I picked it up one day and made the mistake of watching this thing through, but it was quite a struggle to get to the end.<br /><br />The plot is bad; the acting worse; and the writing would seem to have come from a Chimp with Down Syndrome.<br /><br />If you watch this, I salute you for watching from start to finish. I had to take the batteries out of my remote to keep from hitting eject. I guess I'm just a glutton for punishment.<br /><br />Unlike those films that are "So bad, they're good" this is the kind of movie that even a few pints can not make enjoyable...
