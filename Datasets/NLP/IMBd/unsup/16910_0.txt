Okay, okay, so you hear magazines complain about this remake of the old Hitchcock movie (Dial M For Murder) and ditch it without a second thought. Get over it. This movie is almost as good, with some very talented actors, and plenty of twists. For those who haven't seen the original, you'll like this one even more.<br /><br />The story goes something like this: You have an apparently doting husband who is going through some financial struggles, and his wife, an apparently faithful lady, who, unlike her hubby, is doing quite well. When the husband discovers that his wife is having an affair, he hires her lover to kill her. And the fun begins. Michael Douglas, Gwyneth Paltrow and Viggo Mortensen are sublime (and convincing) as the lead characters, and for those who complain about A Perfect Murder being a remake, or for those who complain about the older man/younger woman relationship, (something for which other movies such as Entrapment are guilty of too) put those two facts aside and remember that this is just a movie, cleverly made, with more surprises than an episode of Melrose Place (although I can't say that show appeals to me).<br /><br />Give A Perfect Murder the credit it deserves. It's a great film.
