This documentary manages to both explain a complicated legal process, and tell an emotionally affecting story. I wish everyone could see this, as it has the power to inspire more people who are pro-marriage equality to take action -- and possibly change some hearts and minds on the other side. Though there are plenty of ultra-conservative types who may never be swayed, I think many others could be if they connected a human face to the issue. We see it happen over the course of this film with one Massachusetts legislator in particular, and that effect could be replicated in other states if we all take the time to share our opinions and stories -- and mobilize ourselves into a political force to be reckoned with. Change is coming no matter what, but let's make it happen in our lifetime!
