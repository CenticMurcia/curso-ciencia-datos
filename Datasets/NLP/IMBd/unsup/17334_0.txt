This movie started off like any other horror flick. Especially a Texas chainsaw massacre flick but this movie answers so many questions from the first one and really makes it look like this movie should come first. The blood effects are amazing and the storyline was fresh and overall the movie was amazing! It took a little getting used to because although it was a lot like the first one it was very different. I won't spoil it for ya but this one makes the first one look like a Teletubbies Christmas Special! If you love gore, suspense, terror, and the symbol of all that is just plain wrong then The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning is just your slasher!
