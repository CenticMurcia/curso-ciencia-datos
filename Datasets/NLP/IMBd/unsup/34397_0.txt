When I first saw this I thought this was either going to be educational or exploitive. Turned out it wasn't really either. I assumed that a documentary about anyone's life would be any more informative than one made about anyone else's life. There are interesting points, like the medical and the fact these people are just as messed up as the rest of us. The youngest boy is normal sized, typical kid. The girl is normal sized and just wants to please her parents. There are the mixed twins, one small. The father is loud and controlling in every aspect except his kids, unless it reflects on him, such as the one's child inability to pass the driver's test. The Mom is just as dominating in her children's life. She is a vicariously living control freak. She flips on the smallest things, be good flips or bad ones A problem with is their lack of understanding of their eldest normal sized son. The Roloffs teach others how to cope with a small person. It's obvious they have no clue about racing a normal sized kid. Their eldest boy is a typical teen, he dislikes school, he's more interested in his friends than his family, and takes a lot of things with usual teen casualness. They try to make him feel like he's the one who is different. If he gets an opportunity the other twin's size prohibits and isn't ecstatic, he's a brat. They forget it isn't his fault they're small and he shouldn't be the one the worker tallees, he isn't Gulliver. What is up with that house? It's such a pig sty.
