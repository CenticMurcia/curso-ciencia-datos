The Crow Salvation is a film that was personally in my opinion and I am sure, many others opinions, a step up from The Crow: City Of Angels. It's true, in most respects, it is.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this movie doesn't quite focus on the poetry and melancholic views that the first one showed and maybe the second one showed as well. Though it is somewhat an original story in terms of the twists, and how Alex Corvis is executed for murder and is set out to find the killer(s). Almost like Poetic Justice.<br /><br />This movie more focuses on the action of the movie instead of the sadness involved, but in most respects as said earlier, it is a step up. You might consider this to be a movie that is more appealed to a more teen audience.<br /><br />Eric Mabius makes a really good Crow, though he is sort of a more "anti-hero" filled with rage in this movie instead of a good guy. Unfortunately, his look as the crow isn't exactly cool, instead, he looks kind of gross. This movie also isn't as dark as the first two were.<br /><br />Kirsten Dunst's performance was terrible. I think she makes a better child actress than an adult/teen actress.<br /><br />Jodi Lynn O'Keefe's performance was awesome, and she is so beautiful. In a way she has a little bit of resemblance to Shelly in the first Crow.<br /><br />Still, I'll recommend this one anyway even if it doesn't make up to the first crow, but it does make up to the second one.
