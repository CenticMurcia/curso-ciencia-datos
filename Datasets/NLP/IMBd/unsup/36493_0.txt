I'd seen the page for this movie on IMDb almost 2 years before I finally got to see it. I loved the cast members...Jennifer Ehle, Jeremy Northam, and Gwyneth Paltrow, so I figured it was going to be good. But it was only so-so. It was very disappointing. I liked the love story between the two from the 19th century (Ehle and Northam), but the modern story wasn't all that interesting. I am sorry to say that this one is only mediocre. See it if you must, but I've seen all the leads in better roles.
