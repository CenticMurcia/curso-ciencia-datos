For Keloglan Kara Prens'e Karsi, I thought that, this movie is the worst movie ever made and in my whole life, I won't be able to see another one this bad. But now I understand, I was totally wrong. "Dunyayi Kurtaran Adamin Oglu" is much more successful in being a bad movie than Keloglan Kara Prens'e Karsi. Now I think, as long as the Turkish film producers continue to make movies, I'll continue to see unbelievably bad movies. The money, which I gave for this film was not much, but I feel sorry for my 2 hours spent for nothing. Yes, this movie is nothing. Please take my recommendation: Even if someone gives you money to watch this movie, don't even think about it. I can tell you numerous reasons about why I like a movie. But for this one, there's simply nothing to say. It was supposed to be a comedy film, but I didn't even smile!! Come on guys, is the script writer an 8 year old boy or what? What were you thinking? The original cult film "The man who saves the world" was also a bad movie but at least it was funny, not boring. There were scenes, which one wants to see. But for this, there's nothing to say. I assume that, this film is a bad joke for Turkish people.
