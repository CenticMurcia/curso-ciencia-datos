A bunch of young adults go deep into the woods to a remote cabin and tell each other several scary urban legend-style stories. First and coolest vignette - A diminutive albino Bigfoot creature stalks a teenage couple who find themselves stuck in the middle of nowhere after their car runs out of gas. Second and most frightening tale - Three college fraternity pledges spend the night at an old abandoned hospital that's said to be haunted. Third and most disturbing yarn - A mousy, repressed young coed turns out to be a deranged murderess. Finally, our motley group of young adults discover that the local legend of a vicious Indian wind demon isn't far-fetched in the least. Director James L. Wilson and writer Richard H. Wadsack neatly craft a fun and engrossing omnibus outing that eschews the usual graphic gore and bloodshed in favor of creating and sustaining a potently creepy and nightmarish midnight-in-the-graveyard gloom-doom atmosphere; the opening credits sequence in particular is very chilling and the conclusion packs one hell of a terrifying punch. The isolated sylvan setting projects a truly unnerving sense of dread and vulnerability. The spirited shivery'n'shuddery score by Don Zimmers does the flesh-crawling trick. The pretty, fairly polished cinematography by Robert E. Rogers likewise hits the spot. Moreover, the game no-name cast all contribute winningly sincere and enthusiastic performances. A shamefully neglected and unheralded drive-in terror treat.
