I saw this movie three years ago on tape when i rented it. since i live right across the street from it i walk there. I was going through all these films in the 's' section. i came across shark attack 3, shark zone, shark hunter, when i came across a tape of shark attack. i had seen the third many times, so i thought it would be a great film to laugh at. while walking home, i had to stop every five seconds to look at the boxart and read the back and look at the tape, it took me an hour to walk 5 hundred feet when it usually takes me 20 minutes. When i put it in, the first five minutes were boring. 15-20 minutes into the film i was so distracted by all the people in the house because they were family i made it to the part where he is talking to a guy in a lab with shark things all around him. since a few other people were watching it i left it on, i decided to watch it some other day and never did and they were selling tapes and somebody else bought it and i'm gonna buy it soon. All i can say is the film's first half hour is boring, but it has a lot of action, so it is okay, the paragraph above is just to keep you entertained because there isn't a lot to say about this junk, just treasure how bad the film is. 4/10 stars.
