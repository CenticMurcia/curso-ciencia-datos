Almost a perfect movie. Everyone needs to see this one.<br /><br />Jeff Daniels and Laura Linney are both extraordinary. Factor in the performances of Jesse Eisenberg and Owen Kline and this may be the most well-acted movie I've seen in a couple of years.<br /><br />I've never enjoyed watching Daniels so much. Kline hits a home-run in his first major role. Eisenberg's performance is Oscar-worthy. (Yes, Daniels is great, but Eisenberg earns a Best Supporting Actor nomination in this one!)<br /><br />What I enjoyed most of all is how some very, VERY delicate humor is brilliantly woven throughout this incredibly sad movie.<br /><br />Cheers to Noah Baumbach for putting his life on paper and letting these terrific actors tell the tale.<br /><br />That's it. Thanks for reading.
