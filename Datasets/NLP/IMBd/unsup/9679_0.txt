Ah yes, finally the long awaited `Chasing Papi' as finally came out.<br /><br />The film stars Rosalyn Sanchez, Sofia Vergara and Jaci Velasquez as three feisty Latinas..one is a Cocktail waitress, Ceci, (Sofia Vergara), a lawyer for the people, Lorena,(Rosalyn Sanchez) and a rich spoiled brat who is na√Øve to the world, Patricia (Jaci Velasquez). They are all in love and want to marry the same man Tomas (Eduardo Verastegui), who is stressing out cause of the many relationship...<br /><br />When the three women want to surprise their love with a surprise visit all hell breaks loose. Tomas starts to really stress and he takes too man tranks and falls asleep for a really long time.and the girls are trying to figure out what to do..<br /><br />I found the movie to be very funny and the actresses were very beautiful. The movie is predicable and the dialog is a little lame, but it is entertaining and there are a few surprises.I smiled and found myself really enjoying it.<br /><br />I am glad that this film was made. It is cool to see a Romantic Comedy have an all Latin cast and it was good to see Latinas being successful in life, rather then just being a maid or some illegal.<br /><br />I recommend it! I will post some pics from the film!<br /><br />Rated PG for suggestive humor!
