I think that Frasier not good. It does not probably deserve a vote of 1 from me, I used to watch the show happily before I had taste. I just wish my TV remote control had a picture of Frasier with a line through it. I turn the TV on, it is Frasier. It's like my cable lineup is the all Frasier channel, all the time, then, when Frasier is over, Becker reruns. I almost miss the John Laroquette Show. Look, I can't afford them fancy Tivos, I hate turning on the TV and seeing that dipass Frasier. I want to kick him in the nuts. If I ever see him in an airport or anything, I swear to Christ I will kick him in the balls, then I will roar and beat my chest. I think that Frasier not good. Frasier... gay...ish.
