Well-meaning but somewhat unrealistic "Lifetime Original Production" that has actress Danielle Panabaker as a lovelorn good-grade getting teenager who suddenly finds herself pregnant during her sophomore year of high-school. Like most young women who make the same mistake at this age, Panabaker looks to her mother (played by a loving but intense Mercedes Ruhl) for advice and in response she promptly pulls her out of school, picks up and moves as quickly as possible to another town where no one will know who they are, warns Panabaker to never contact the child's father and tell him about the situation and ultimately decides that instead of having to explain her grandchild's origins and the whole messy problem itself to a new set of people she just pretends the infant is hers...one of those late-in-life babies born to a middle-aged woman shortly before her divorce through what seems like some sort-of miracle and without the hassle of the whole in-vitro process. Of course, that plan backfires in the mother and daughter's faces shortly after their new adjustment due mostly to the racked-up guilt that the young woman has for not being a real mother to her child, and instead having her own mother build up a facade around the actual truth of the situation just to save face of both her mother's and her own, also for not telling the baby's birth father her reasons for running out on him was that she was pregnant and scared and finally because of the interest a childless sex-education/sociology teacher (played by Jane Krackowski), herself trying desperately to become a mother with little luck, takes in her seemingly odd situation eventually forcing Panabaker to reveal the truth behind it leaving her character wondering if putting her baby up for adoption wouldn't be the best answer to her and her family's pressing problems. In and amongst the somewhat complicated story we see Panabaker's much younger sister (played by Clare Stone) falling apart at the seams, a la becoming more and more introverted and wild, even going so far as to attempt a quick runaway one night which she finds to be a big mistake because the streets are a dangerous and frightening place to live on at any age. All of the actors here are pretty good in their respective roles. And I personally was particularly impressed with the discussions about love, sex and young parenthood which are all dealt with in a surprisingly tasteful and very matter-of-fact way making it sound and feel as if it were an important and meaningful touch added to the film's already tedious and heavy subject matter. However, even with those somewhat high marks added to it, "Mom At Sixteen" still fails in it's attempts at coming across as realistically as possible due greatly to the facts that the characters are not as well-written nor nearly as fully-developed as they should have been, and even the story itself takes too many twists right smack in the middle of it which ultimately causes the remainder of the film to fall apart towards the extremely unsatisfactory and sadly contrived ending. Overall, the film virtually leaves us as an audience to feel, when all is said and done, that it is little more than an artificial and slightly shallow misrepresentation of many real-life situations similar to what Panabaker's character goes through here.
