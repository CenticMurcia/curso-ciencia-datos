Winter, falling leaves, wind, and coldness- those are the main elements we can get from this film. Of course, they create the atmosphere so good, together with the story and the characters. we can see 5 different story's in the film, which connected by technical things (live in the same building, work together or for each other) and the fact that they're all telling us story's about- family relationships, love, and craving for warmness. With the winter, and the great classical music, they remind us the need of the proximity between people, and inside the family. Every character, represent a sense, in a directly way, or the opposite- the lack of the sense. In the main story- a little child got lost,and it's influencing everyone- The mother, the women whom her daughter left the little girl at the park by her self, the doctor who misses his little girl and ask by the police about the misses girl,and the single women and her friend who feel it's a bad sign. The movie start with allot of sadness, (beside the cynical single), but ends with a note of optimism- and again, beside the single women, who gets a big disappointment from her men. The message- everyone wants to be loved, and to have this safe feeling that there is someone who cares for you, and return you in the same way you give him.
