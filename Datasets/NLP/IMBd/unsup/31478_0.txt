Complete bakwaas in story, dialoge, dramatization, editing and accuracy. 3.5 ghante ka torture .. Hoping someone will edit cut it down to 15 minutes and post it on Youtube ( hehe)<br /><br />politically correct, historically inaccurate, financially flushed, glamorized notions ... look at Ashoka - I personally hated that - after all these reviews, I a can only imagine what a torture it would be sit through 3.5 hrs. Modern day movie makers insist on showing every little piece of crap they get on film - editing and dramatization has absolutely no meaning.. On a tangent here - look at old and new Don... the older director gives more credit to the Audience than the newer one... the new ones make it a point to spell out the subtleties consequently destroying the entire scene ( got that off my chest )<br /><br />The 10 lines rule is quite painful. I am not a big writer like Mr. Sardarji above ... Let us hope this gets submitted - or else I will have to copy and paste his stuff here - just to fill the lines.
