Great for this kind of movie - Stallone wasn't invincible & did some fine acting - His introspection choosing humanity did not come off as corny & I felt his character was very likable.<br /><br />Mickey Rourke keeps alive the question of whether he is crazier on screen or off - Will he grow up & become Christopher Walken later in life?<br /><br />Miranda & Rachel both get A's for acting outside the stereotype - I'd like to give the little French girl a bite at her spot of specification - The film's dialogue was better than usual as was all its writing.<br /><br />No gaffs, major or minor - I enjoyed this remake more than its original, which was also worth viewing in my opinion but just didn't get my involvement or support as much as this one - I'd stay up late to watch this one again.
