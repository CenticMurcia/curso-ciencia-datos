I have loved this Movie ever since it's release in 77 i believe. I can not say enough in terms of touting this story's appeal to all those looking for that one movie that shows a Womans courage and determination. Beau Bridges set the standard for what I think a True Man is like. He gave a Very Fine performance! The part that truly had me crying my eyes out was when she/Jill was waiting for Dick to give her that call,but it never came. And I will not say why the call did'nt come because if I did, I would actually feel tears welling up in my eyes. The ending was VERY Poignant and also left me with a feeling like This Woman is gonna be OK. She has conquered the most devastating of Tradgedies and has emerged from it with the Courage of a True Hero! God-Bless YOU Jill Kinmont.
