For some odd reason "7th heaven" even aired here in Austria. I only watched one episode but I have to say that absolutely nothing I've ever seen compares to this series and it's the only production that I would rate even lower than IMDb allows to (minus 10 actually).<br /><br />"7th heaven" tries so hard in telling you what's wrong or right it will make you feel traumatized. After all, the series actually works - but in the opposite direction. After watching this episode I somehow felt the urge to smoke a pot and drink alcohol while having sex with a prostitute and screaming "Jesus hates you".<br /><br />Don't even bother watching this!
