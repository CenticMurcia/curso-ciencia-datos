Yes, another Sunshine fan. I'm an old hippie. This movie has stayed fresh in my heart and mind and I would really love to be able to purchase it. I bought the audio "tape" of the film years ago after I had seen it and wore the poor thing to death. I know all the words and songs and just cant get enough. It is indeed a most beautiful heartfelt movie that is timeless, as it touches aspects of life that cannot be lost with changes over the decades. A niece of mine found a copy of it for me on Ebay but it turned out to be a really really poor copy that had been taped from the TV (with ads!) Argh! Anyway if anyone at all can help me out to point me in the right direction as to where I may purchase the DVD, please please please let me know. Cheers good people.
