This movie was filmed local to me on the beautiful Magenta Beach just north of The Entrance. The surroundings and the teaser poster were the highlight of the feature. After receiving a special invite to its opening the movie played host to something disastrous. The premise is good. A group of friends going away for the weekend at a remote beach only to be confronted by a menace camping nearby. The acting and scripting were disgraceful and as a huge Indy and Horror fan what little hope I had left of this movie quickly diminished. For one, the writers/directors/production people seemed to of not really known how they were going to play out the guts of the movie as it chopped and changed and jumped around into an obligatory mess. This movie even made the tragic Aussie horror Blood Moon look like Oscar material. If you want a good classic horror/thriller stick to The Boys or Long Weekend.
