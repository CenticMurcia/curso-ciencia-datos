Movie was slow moving in general, the plot was simplistic and is a smash between the Saw series and a CSI episode, but potentially less entertaining than either of the two. There was gore and disturbing content which in my opinion may have been inappropriate for the story. It could have been just as powerful without the disturbing pseudo-snuff film scenes as a police film and the suspense could be maximized, or the director should have made the call to make it more like a Saw movie, maintain the disturbing content and bring that fan base in. The target in my opinion was broad, drew in viewers who will be disappointed. Overall, if the movie moved a little quicker, or was potentially less graphic it might have earned a 6. To sum it all up, it was 20 minutes longer than it should have been and was misguided. Potentially worth a rental but even questionable in that case.
