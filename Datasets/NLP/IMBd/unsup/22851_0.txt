I thought that the film, despite its low budget, was better than I initially expected, but still poor. The acting was okay and the CGI was not particularly great, but what do you expect from such a low budget film? One of the major downsides to the DVD version of the film (I purchased it for about 50p) is that in the trailer to the film gives away the ending - a woman blasting a giant spider with a bazooka - which is one of the, if not the, most important part. However, this was not really too big a deal, as the film is predictable enough anyway. The film was followed by a sequel, which involves even more spiders and is just as good (or should I say bad).
