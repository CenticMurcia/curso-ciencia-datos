My Take: A cult classic holiday comedy with wild knowing in-jokes and crazy special effects. <br /><br />I watched the sequel before watching this original. I like both films the same, one of the best horror/comedy films, and maybe one of the best film of all time. The story is memorable and director Joe Dante and Executive producer Steven Spielberg gives all their best to adapt Chris Colombus' offbeat and quirky script.<br /><br />Who would forget the early nights before Christmas, when young Billy Peltzer (Zach Galligan) receives the cute furball Gizmo as a present fro his dad (Hoyt Axton)? And who would also forget the bad results when the three very important rules (1. Don't Expose them to bright light 2. Don't get him wet 3. (Most importantly!!!) Don't feed them after midnight) are broken? And finally, who would forget the mischief and mayhem the night before Christmas, and the endless fun at every viewing?<br /><br />GREMLINS is that familiar movie that you couldn't help but love, even if some of its standards don't live up. Sure the special effects are long surpassed and so is the pacing, but GREMLINS is that classic in its own way that you'll just love it the way it is. <br /><br />Rating: **** out of 5.
