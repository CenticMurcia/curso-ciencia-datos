Unremarkable love story between a well educated woman (Scachi) and a simple Scottish sailor (D'Onofrio) that goes on and on for almost thirty years. They lived separate lives but sometimes they get together and live passionate and feverish days of pure joy and lovemaking. A thin plot and cardboard characterizations and dialogues make this one a boring and peasant look upon the problems of the relationship of two diferent persons. Besides, D'Onofrio is completely miscast in the role of a Scottish fellow. I give this a 4 (four).
