While this film is only less than 75 minutes in length, the bodies begin to pile up rather quickly. This includes a narcotics agent, 2 members of the gang, and an elevator runner, who stupidly announces that she can get her face in the papers for identifying the killers of a gang member while riding in her elevator. How stupid can you get?<br /><br />The story centers on the familiar theme of drugs. In this one, a supposed respectable businessman is running some drugs from Mexico to California. The scenes shift quickly from both these areas constantly.<br /><br />The new elevator operator is a plant from the narcotics squad and you have to hand it to them. They actually have honing devices to track cars that they're following. It's only 1950.<br /><br />The problem with the film is that the characters are really flat. Too bad that first elevator operator wasn't around long enough.
