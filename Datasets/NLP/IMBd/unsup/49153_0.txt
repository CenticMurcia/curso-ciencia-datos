Disappointing. The basically vapid plot butchered what could have been an interesting idea. The film seems to rely excessively on the appeal of Aishwarya and Salman to conceal the fundamental flaws of bad acting, toilet humor, and cheesy songs. In addition, some of the sets were clearly faked. Now, I know Bollywood, and I would have been willing to put up with some cheesiness and inconsistencies if I saw occasional good acting and at least one catchy tune. Right off the bat, all I saw was Aishwarya giggling and acting like a dumb little pretty face, which is SO not what I expect from her. Salman's acting, emotions, and lip-synching seem utterly contrived and lifeless. Shah Rukh Khan is so much better and so much more emotionally charged! If you are a newcomer to Indian films, like me, go rent "Devdas" or "Kal Ho Naa Ho" instead. Maybe I have Western tastes or whatever, but I've seen a lot of corny musicals in my time, and liked most of them. This was the bottom of the barrel, and I can hardly believe that that Bhansali went on to make "Devdas" after producing this cheap masala movie. PS I am a fourth generation Italian American. Salman's scene where he makes up a stupid "Italian" custom downright enraged me. Was it the director's intent to B.S. this way?? I feel I am being generous by giving this film four stars.
