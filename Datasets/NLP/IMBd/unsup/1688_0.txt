This movie was the type of pokemon movie I always wanted to see. A lot of fun. I was hooked from the first battle scene. After all the previous ones I've seen (havent seen 3 & 4 yet) this one I found the best.<br /><br />I like the intro to these movies as they give a brief explanation of pokemon, this movie showed a few scenes from the previous movies.<br /><br />The starting fight between the alien poke and the earth one was cool, showing off the aliens strength for a little while.<br /><br />I liked the few scenes just with poke doing amusing things with feelgood background music.<br /><br />Ash is the focus of course, a few new characters and poke are introduced, and its good to see Tory make friends with those plus and minus pokemon.<br /><br />After the end you see everyone board a train and go their separate ways which ended it nicely.<br /><br />Really enjoyable movie in the hi tech city.
