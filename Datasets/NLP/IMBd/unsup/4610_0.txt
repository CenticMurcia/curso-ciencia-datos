I only just watched this film for the first time. Saw it on my laptop. I just adored this movie ...everyone in it and the way it was made. The first great thing about it was how totally simpathico I felt with the mum. The so unhollywood adorable mum. Everyone in the film reminded me of someone I know. To tell you the truth I was blubbering wreck by the end because there was so many resonances with my own life, with the relationship I have with my own daughter, with the way men behave in real life. I checked out the database for further films made by the director but there were none.???? I cant believe that after such a wonderful debut Benito Zambrano hasn't gone on to make it big in the film world. There is a gaping void out there waiting to be filled by directors of his calibre. Can I make plea for more movies in this genre please. Also on a very personal level it is a knitting movie and I am collecting them so it instantly goes into my top ten.
