Ernie Reyes Jr. and Sr. made a film with no moral integrity. They make drug dealing look like a decent way to make a living and try to make smoking and cursing like a sailor look cool. They did have a lot of catholic imagery in the film so i guess it is ok to be a bad person as long as you read the bible. Also, there are some weird scenes that involve the villian cross dressing. This being said some of the fight scenes were pretty good.
