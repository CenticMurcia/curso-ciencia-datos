this is a well-made documentary. it points out that Moore denounces the epidemically separating rich and poor while being himself "a rich white man." But even if he has made money in his life, his messages are still important in that they expose, more than any other source, the failing of our nation whether by chance or design. The fact that the US has terrible ratios of health care and education to its financial status was demonstrated through the Sicko documentary and reached a whole lot of people who probably weren't previously aware that the 1st world nations outside of the USA have for the large majority much better civic systems in place. This documentary denounces Moore for being openly critical of US policy and for helping to repair the ignorance of the people therein to the short-comings of their governance. This documentary will be frustrating to anyone who is already done with the US war policy, but it will help assuage those not yet ready to admit they made a mistake when they voted for Bush. This documentary takes a boy's defense of his father's work ethic and aims it at a man who has done a great work toward opening the eyes of a nation toward the misdirections of its leadership -- a great work ethic in itself. Long live Michael Moore and the style in which he empowers us with knowledge. Meanwhile, may this documentary based on an attack on his person remind us that we cannot save everyone because that is why it takes a Michael Moore to awaken those who can't find the light switch on their own. The real shame in this documentary is that this man's father suffered the same fate as Michael's own father (twice apparently). But while Moore used the shrinking US job market as an entry point into a career exposing the economic slavery being imposed on this nation (and others), this fellow chooses to attack a man that should very well be a hero to his father and surely his own self.
