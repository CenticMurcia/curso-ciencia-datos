I would say for making a movie during the writer's strike, on a very limited budget, this film managed to satisfy the crowd that I sat in when I first viewed it. It was shown on a college campus in 1993, and many enjoyed it so much they returned to watch it again. Keep in mind, it was made 13 years ago. Technology today has given even the low budget filmmakers the opportunity to enhance their product and accomplish things never possible in the past. It did cross genres, which is a no-no to some, but there are many other films that have done the same thing with much success. I think every filmmaker should be applauded for their work, no matter how good or bad the public views their art. There are so many components that can make or break a film, through editing, and on through distribution. So, please give this film a break. Grab a bowl of cereal and have fun with it!
