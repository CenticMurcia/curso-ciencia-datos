I wanted to say that I concur with the previous members' reviews of REACH THE ROCK. This movie holds a special place in my heart, because it was partially filmed in my own town, Westmont, Illinois. The park district and senior center were dramatically remodeled, with SHERMER POLICE DEPARTMENT on our senior center. John Hughes' crew and production company were in town a few weeks. The dramatic events that took place during the filming were amazing! Never being on a film set, and having our town being used for the film made it especially memorable. Only bad part was that the scene where the main character "escapes" from the jail, and steals the squad car were probably 4 mins. of the entire film. Another community about 25 miles away (West Chicago, IL) was used for other parts of the film. I was disappointed that it never made it to the big screen. I caught it on our local WGN-TV one Sunday afternoon, purely out of coincidence. It is a story worth watching, so I do recommend it.
