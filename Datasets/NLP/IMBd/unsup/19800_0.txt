I never even knew about this film when it came out. Since I hear it only grossed 6.5 million that explains why. The producers probably didn't even keep in the theaters a week. I can't explain what makes a film flop at the box office, but this one certainly didn't deserve it.<br /><br />From start to finish I was totally enraptured by this witty story of a man who held views so controversial they are practically comical all by themselves. The movie is based on a novel which is a work of fiction, but it nevertheless draws its subject matter from some very true aspects of Dr. Kellogg's life that are quite unusual and almost always surprising. As these surprises are revealed to you throughout the film, they come as even more of a shock every time. There are a number of stories told throughout the sanitarium and each is a delight in and of itself. The stories all manage to interweave, sometimes in very comical ways, and despite their comedy, teach some very practical lessons. It is almost satirical.<br /><br />I give this film two thumbs up. Don't watch it in mixed company and it certainly isn't appropriate for children. But for those with a mature attitude and an appreciation of the health nut culture, it will make for a laugh-filled evening.
