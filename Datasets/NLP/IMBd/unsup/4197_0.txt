Legendary Michael Curtiz directs a solid western. Faultless production and photography. Errol Flynn stars in his first western movie. Flynn plays Wade Hutton, a cattleman like the rest of Dodge City tired of being under the thumb of the ruthless Jeff Surrett(Bruce Cabot). Hutton becomes the Sheriff and with the help of Abbie Irving(Olivia de Havilland)and her newspaper tries to corral Surrett and his gang in order to bring some peace to town.<br /><br />Others in the cast: Alan Hale, Victor Jory, Ann Sheridan, Frank McHugh, Ward Bond and Monte Blue. Flynn seems to not take the role very seriously even if he does wear the biggest hat. The script doesn't worry too much about his British accent; but Errol always brings with him self assuredness and healthy helping of aloofness. DODGE CITY was filmed in sunny California, mostly around Modesto and Frisco.
