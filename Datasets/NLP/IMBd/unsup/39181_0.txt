I was in a mediocre hotel in England, up at two in the morning and couldn't get to sleep. I decided to put the TV on and one of the first channels I flipped to was a show starring Christopher Lloyd. It looked pretty bad, but there was something about it that was strangely fascinating...<br /><br />I later found out that it was not actually a TV show, but rather a television movie. (Wow, big difference.) Christopher Lloyd plays Quicksilver, a mysterious old man who roams the country delivering moral tales. His first he delivers to a newlywed bride whose car has broken down, and whose husband has wandered away looking for a gas station.<br /><br />His tale involves a similar fate involving a man named Charlie (Matt Frewer) who picks up a hitchhiker and is nearly killed by him.<br /><br />The next involves a man whose hand is chopped off by his other hand (!) and all the hands in the world start a revolt. Yes, it's as silly as it sounds, and hilarious to watch.<br /><br />The movie is perhaps unintentionally bad, but I was entertained. It's a very corny, silly movie that is easy to watch. The special effects are simply awful in the hand-attack narrative. I loved it.<br /><br />Lloyd is overacting (or overREacting?) in a script full of clich√©s. Author Clive Barker and director John Landis even offer their not-so-subtle cameos.<br /><br />All in all, if you have nothing better to watch, this WILL keep you very entertained...a huge guilty pleasure.
