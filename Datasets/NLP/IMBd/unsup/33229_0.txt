I must admit that after watching Project Greenlight every Sunday night, I was not expecting much. I was pleasantly surprised with the results. This is a very enjoyable film. Shia is great in this role. He was the perfect choice. Good job with the editing...specially the hospital scene with Kelly and his parents!!!
