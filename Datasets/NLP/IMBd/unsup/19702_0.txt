whoever thought that this movie was a thing that needed to exist needs to be dragged out of Hollywood and thrown in a stockade. or at least a brig.<br /><br />Bizarre pro-drug war, wet dream of Monroe-doctrine-humping idiots. cheesy like Velveeta, and not in the good sense. I haven't even finished the movie and I'm already wanting my life back.<br /><br />the plot is nonsensical, the "twist" is about as bendy as a re-bar, and the characters as believable as three dollar bills. Racial stereotypes are played for their full effect, it's a low point in the career of everyone involved.<br /><br />hell the planes aren't any good either, which was the best part of the first two.<br /><br />The only redeeming quality is that it ends. it's biggest flaw is that it starts. save your money on the rental. just grab a stick, sharpen it and poke yourself in the eye repeatedly. it'll be more amusing.
