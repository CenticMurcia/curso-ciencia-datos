Am I'm the only one that can see that this movie is not all that? Besides the acting, which I thought it was good. The story has so many inconsistency that I can't see why would a person would want to see something as corny as this. I see the connections that the characters have towards each respected country but towards the end I just keep saying so what!'. The camera shots where great but the action.well if you call a lot of gun shots action, then, I guess this movie has a lot of action. I didn't like the plot and even though they tried to dramatize it a little bit at the end it doesn't compensate and it will leave instead of wanting more', wanting something'. There is nothing special on this film, even the logic of time traveling doesn't make sense, I ask, how come an ancient civilization discover the power of time travel? But I guess superstition is stronger than logic. But since its sci-fi, I can't go into much detail because at the end it's just not real even though some sci-fi films seem more believable than this. But I guess I wasn't emotionally connected to this film as some of my fellow reviewers. But take my word for it, you are not missing much.
