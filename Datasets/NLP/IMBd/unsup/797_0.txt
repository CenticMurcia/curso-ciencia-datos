The alien-episodes have always been my favorites, but this one wasn't as great as i hoped for to be honest. The black lady in the FBI was pretty darn dumb about the tactics, that annoyed me. I didn't really understand if Duane was lying or not. If he was telling the truth, why would they add the whole "he was shot in the head blabla"-part? And if he was lying, the episode would be kind of pointless. Something that was also annoying was the blinking lights in the alien-scenes. I actually had to close my eyes to not get a headache! The last scene was good, was scary when Scully saw Duane in the window. Duane Barry was an exciting episode. First episode we got to see aliens alive!<br /><br />Best moment: When Mulder got Duane to get to the door <br /><br />Worst moment: When the black lady was talking about the tactics
