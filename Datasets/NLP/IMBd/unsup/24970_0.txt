An average courtroom drama that's made watchable by the always superb Stockard Channing. Who plays a chain-smoking, wheelchair using lawyer filled with angst. It's not often you see such a strong, disabled female character, Stockard Channing is a master stroke in casting, she plays the role with inteligence and a intuitive subtlety. Class stuff one one of the finest ever actresses.
