This movie is painfully bad. One presumes the authors are trying to make a statement about fate; instead they reduce their characters to automatons who behave meaninglessly.<br /><br />This makes the movie, frankly, boring, and removes any reason to care about what happens to the characters. Furthermore, the fate that befalls the characters manages to be simultaneously hackneyed and absurd (a modest accomplishment, I suppose). If you are compelled to watch this, try to watch a version in a language you don't speak, so you can ignore the "story" and focus on the pictures. Better still, find some stills on the net and use those two hours of your life to do something interesting like cleaning the grout in your shower stall.
