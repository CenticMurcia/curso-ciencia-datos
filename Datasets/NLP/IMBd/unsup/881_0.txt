I would just like to know where to buy this movie, without having to purchase it online. I have looked everywhere for this movie to purchase but a lot of people have never heard of it. They don't know what they are missing!! This is a keeper! I bet I come up with and use lines from this movie at least once or twice a week. The Hello song is one of my favorite ones. Working for a telephone answering service fits right in with the Hello song! I ask a lot of people about this movie and they look at me as if I'm crazy! They say they have never seen, let alone heard of it and think I need to be committed! I would love to buy this movie, I just don't have the luxury of purchasing things online. If anyone can help me, please advise. I would be most grateful!
