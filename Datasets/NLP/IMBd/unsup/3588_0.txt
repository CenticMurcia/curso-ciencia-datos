A severely deranged wacko psycho killer dressed in shiny skintight black leather and a motorcycle helmet brutally bags a bunch of beautiful young fashion models who all work for the same agency in this splendidly sleazy and notoriously nasty piece of typically twisted, yet stylish and polished low-grade Italian giallio murder mystery slasher thriller junk. Of course, true to the picture's irresistibly shameless come-on title the loony forces all the poor gals to doff their duds and bare their exquisite bodies before butchering them! Probable suspects include the disgusting fat slob owner of the agency, tubbo's frosty ice queen predatory lesbian wife, womanizing heel photographer Nino Castelnuovo, and his sexy lady assistant Edwige Fenech.<br /><br />Directed with an admirable lack of taste and restraint by Andrea Bianchi (the same sweet, subtle, sophisticated gent who blessed us with the insanely gory and over-the-top zombie gut-cruncher "Burial Ground"), who pours on the gratuitous nudity and explicit violence with cheerfully crass abandon (the kill scenes are quite vicious and gruesome while the generously well-proportioned Femi Benussi in particular offers the viewers an amazingly ample eyeful sans clothes). Moreover, Franco Delli Colli's slick, sparkling cinematography and Berto Pisano's bubbly, elegant score ensure that the film both looks and sounds excellent (I especially dug the funky, throbbing discoid opening credits theme music). Blue Underground strikes again with a lovely letterboxed DVD presentation of this terrifically trashy treat, offering an uncut print that's in pristine shape along with a deliciously lurid trailer and a nice 12 minute interview featurette with actress Solvi Stubing and co-screenwriter Massimo Felisatti as the up to snuff extras.
