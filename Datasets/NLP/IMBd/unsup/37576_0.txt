Really bad movie about a guy on campus who is about to be thrown out of school since he can't pay his tuition bill. He falls asleep in his marketing class. He doesn't get berated but instead the so called professor comes on like an uncle.<br /><br />What goes on on this campus? Everyone is partying and appears unbelievably dumb.<br /><br />Our hero makes male calendars for women. His friend, a cool good looking blond swimmer is on the cover. Editor Morgan Fairchild sees the picture and wants the guy for publicity on her magazine. She is a stickler with a contract and the latter could come back to haunt her.<br /><br />Too bad academia wasn't like this. College would have been a real blast. An excellent film for air-heads but for the normal majority, a complete joke and utter junk.
