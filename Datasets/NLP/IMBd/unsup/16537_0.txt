What else is there to say? <br /><br />"Dis," or better yet, "Haze: A Love Story" is a very romantic and very dark film that has come to us all the way from Norway! The things that I like most about this film is the romance from beginning to end. I know I'm a man full of action, but who doesn't want to sit on down and see a whole lot of kissing, huh? Watching this helps encourage lonely people (regardless of age) to learn how to find that "special someone" and whatnot. Also wonderful are the various scenes which take place in various parts of our planet. The first date scene was at its best, also.<br /><br />Even better is the fact that this movie is European. "Dis" shows us the pros and cons of dating and life, and that if you want to see a foreign film, watch this one!
