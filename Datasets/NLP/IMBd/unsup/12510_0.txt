This film is extremely offensive to just about everybody, but therein lies it's beauty. <br /><br />If you are easily offended especially by the C word you will hate this film.<br /><br />If however you are a teenager or twenty something looking for some hilarity then call round your mates, get them to bring round pizza and beer and you have the recipe for an unforgettable evening.<br /><br />Cook and Moore are absolutely fantastic really work well sparking off each other. <br /><br />This would never be released these days - you are unlikely to find anything like this ever again.
