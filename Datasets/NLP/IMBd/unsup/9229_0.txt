i went to see this the other day at the deep ellum film festival in dallas with a friend who was an extra in it. i didn't know anything about it except that johnny whitworth (who i love from 'empire records') and brian krakow from my so-called are in it. so i didn't know what to expect. it was definitely different than most movies i rent or see. as martha sez, that's a good thing. it had a lotta funny things and the story was kind of twisted. it all took place here in dallas, and it did a good job of showing what a strange-weird-absurd place it can be. i thought the movie did a good job of getting inside the head of a guy who questions everything around him. a lot of the things he said and did definitely rang true for me. 2 thumbs up.
