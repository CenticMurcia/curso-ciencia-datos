<br /><br />The undertaking of the construction of the great canal at Suez was monumental. Sadly, "Suez" was not. Despite the grand beginnings (featuring a breathtaking ball gown with Loretta Young inside it) the film failed to deliver. Predictable in most every way, from the scene with the Indian sand reader to the stormy scenes between Powers and Annabelle. Good special effects. No plot continuity.
