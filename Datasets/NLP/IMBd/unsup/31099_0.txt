I like this show, it has an outstanding cast, a good plot and a very interesting story line. This is a fun movie to watch. I just wish someone would start making movie and/ or mini series like this again. This is so much better than the stuff that passes for entertainment now that it's pathetic. I cannot understand how shows like Deadwood can endure and shows like this not be available at all. This is one of the shows that should be available on DVD. This is one of the great westerns made for TV that in someone's infinite wisdom isn't available yet and may never be. It joins a list including "How the West Was Won" (maybe the best western series ever), The Lazurus Man and Peacemakers. "How the West Was Won" would draw a premium price.Single episode VHS tapes recorded from television are bringing $18.
