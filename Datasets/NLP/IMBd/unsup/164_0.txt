This is one of the finest films I have seen. The story and dialogue are riveting and the work of Colbert, Welles and Brent is superb. The cast achieves the cohesiveness of a fine Broadway production. This film could easily have been nominated for multiple oscars, for Colbert, Welles, and Brent, screen play, and direction. The cinematography and script as well as the overall attention to detail in the dialogue led me to suspect that Welles might have been responsible for more than just his own role. I saw the film once and had to have the video.
