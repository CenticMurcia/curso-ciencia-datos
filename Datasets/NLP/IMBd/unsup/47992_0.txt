Not all things at the end of the rainbow glitter. A demonic little Irishman(Warwick Davis) wreaks havoc in a small town in North Dakota when his golden coins are disturbed. Pretty lame, but decent for late late night viewing. Jennifer Aniston's big screen debut. Also in the cast: Mark Holton, Ken Olandt and Robert Gorman. Bad enough to be funny.
