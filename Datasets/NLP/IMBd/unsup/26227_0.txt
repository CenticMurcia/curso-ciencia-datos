First of all: I like this type of film very much! I was surprised by many comments that talk about a 'foreign film'. As if films from other countries than the USA should have to prove themselves extra... No way! On the contrary! Living in Europe, this isn't a foreign film for me! I was brought up in the sixties, and enjoyed the film-noir genre, the character movies, the French and Italian philosophical movies, the black-and-white films, the films made by the actors, the director and the plot together. So, Swimming Pool is a film that makes me sit on the point of my chair for more than 1 hour and a half. It is an intriguing story, the entire atmosphere is inviting, makes you feel good and being with Sarah/Charlotte all at once. The interference with Sarah and Julie is ambiguous. The continuing layer of lesbian love lays upon their relation, no matter what they do to each other in the beginning of the story. It's a kind of hidden suspense... Ludivine (who plays Julie) is a beautiful, well shaped young girl, with a marvelous body, but even Charlotte Rampling is outspoken and gave herself to the film and to the director, Francois Ozon. A great movie. Just absorb what you see...
