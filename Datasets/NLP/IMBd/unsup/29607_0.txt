Nice to see that there are other fans here, and also people who began to question their own memory or sanity with respect to remembering this show! Man, I now hardly know anyone who saw it, but my then-husband and I were big fans. It didn't air in our region, and we'd use the rabbit-ears and the outside antenna to pull it in from an independent station in a neighboring state.<br /><br />I had considered myself a feminist for years, but I was amazed at how astute this show was in picking up how completely permeated society is with aspects of gender roles. There was always something in that show that made me do a double-take. Some of life's more offensive moments were shown for what they were and yet simultaneously rendered hilarious when role-reversed: the executive women's nearly unconscious treatment of waiters at the local bar, for example.<br /><br />Add me to the folks who would so appreciate it if TV Land would air these ("Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman" too!) or if they were on DVD. Gotta love Norman Lear!
