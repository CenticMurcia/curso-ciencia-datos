First off, all of you that gave this movie a bad review - You probably just don't understand it.<br /><br />And to all of you that haven't seen it but is checking out some reviews before you decide to buy it or download it - You're in for a hell of a ride. As we all know, Rob is very much into vintage horror and having SO much to look at that it almost becomes unwatchable. He made it, it's a true masterpiece! If you're into vintage horror and just love gore - this is a movie for you! The story is simple, classic and great, it's basically the usual - some kids on a road trip doing whatever, end up in hell. Although he added some genius twists here and there. The acting is great, but you have to understand the parts to notice that. Sheri Moon's part requires the kind of acting that either is awful or awesome - she really pulls it of! The rest of the acting is just brilliant.<br /><br />So watch this movie. It's sick, grotesque, beautiful and just brilliant. Rob really know what he's doing!
