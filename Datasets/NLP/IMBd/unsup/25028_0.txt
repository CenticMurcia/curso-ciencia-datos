One of the original video nasties that was released in 1994 with 43 seconds cut. I cannot imagine what 43 seconds were cut out, as we are left with a slasher film that has 13 murders.<br /><br />This film is hailed as the precursor to Halloween and Friday the 13th. It certainly spares no blood, and has a gratuitous decapitation to make it a true nasty.<br /><br />Nudity is at a minimum, with just a skinny dip segment by one of the college kids that happened upon the cottage and set off the chain of murders.<br /><br />It was funny to see the hand almost on the ass of the girl as the long dead body rises to the surface. her friends met a grisly death, with two of them dispatched at once in bed, with the guy on top still pumping away as he is dying.<br /><br />What makes this film very interesting, and may be a distraction for some is the story line. It is minimalist, but there is a story. One man is trying to find out who killed his mother, One women is chasing down the death of her father. Revenge plays a part, but the main story is familiar to those of us here in Florida - greedy developers. Here they only kill wildlife in their quest for land, in this film anyone who gets in the way is dispatched. So, you have not one slasher, but several with different motives.<br /><br />And, just when you think you have finally got everything just the way you want it, Bava throws in a twist that had me laughing my ass off.<br /><br />The jungle music throughout irritated me mildly, but it did fit the scenery.
