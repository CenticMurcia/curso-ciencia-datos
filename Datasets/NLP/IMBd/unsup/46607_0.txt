In my humble opinion (IMHO), you should spend your money elsewhere ! <br /><br />I was foolish enough to think that this could be a funny movie. Big mistake, big mistake -HUGE mistake ! This movie is bad !!! There is no way around it. With the exception of Peter Ustinov, the actors all pretty much sucked ! Even Ren√©e Zellweger whom I loved in "Jerry Maguire" was no good! None of the lines were delivered well, even the funny ones ! They all looked bored and tired, the actors, not the lines... :-) Whoever chose the music, managed to do a pretty bad job of it too. Some classic tunes were ruined in some truly awful scenes. It was just embarrassing to watch. I see about 60 movies in the cinema every year (I'm not a professional critic, I just love films!), and this is the first time EVER I have actually left the theatre 3/4-way through the movie. I stayed that long because I thought may be it would get better. No such luck !<br /><br />
