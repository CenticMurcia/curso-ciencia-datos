The Indigo movie was not well done. There were artistic problems with the movie and it did not live up to the hype. That said I would prefer watching INDIGO with a community of spiritual seekers than to go to 95% of Hollywood films. Hollywood's hold on the movie going audience is more of a problem to me than Indigo. I agree that Indgio was not comparable with What the bleep do we know. But I think the director's have the right idea. Indigo children is a fascinating subject and the movie did not do it justice. I do think that Donald Neale Walsch's acting was good and some of the scenery in the movie was very beautiful. I think that we should strive for excellence in what we do and I wish that the director's and producers could have worked harder to make a more artistic film. I still am glad I went and would rather watch a movie like Indigo that is about redemption than the exploitation that we are exposed to daily in the media and especially Hollywood movies. I liked seeing ordinary people portrayed on screen instead of women that all look like the mainstream idea of beauty. There was a lot of beauty in the film that was not hard to find. I encourage the producers and directors of Indigo to try again make a better film but I feel my money was well spent by going to see Indigo I have spent much money on typical Hollywood films and felt ripped off but I was not at all ripped of financially by Indigo. I would gladly give more that ten bucks to people who really want to raise the level of healing and spirituality in this time of violence and war that we are constantly exposed to. I took my 12 year old daughter and she was interested in the film but did not seem to feel enlightened by it. She thought the actress who portrayed Grace was Slick. I would give Indgio an A for effort and a D for artistry.
