Despite being technically proficient and featuring some good performances (notably from comic actor Eddie Izzard) this film is a dud. Why? Because the writer and director couldn't decide whether they were making a comedy or a drama.<br /><br />The amusingly contrived tank chase at the beginning of the film should have set the scene for a moderately black comedy, but somewhere along the way someone decided that the reality of war should be portrayed. With Matt LeBlanc playing THE MOST UNCONVINCING CROSS DRESSER IN THE HISTORY OF CINEMA? What were they thinking?<br /><br />You can hear the gears clashing as scene-by-scene, we are jolted from half-baked comedy to unconvincing sentimentality. The final unconvincing, violent and desperate scenes where the team of crack drag commandos hijack a plane to get out of Germany set the seal on this straight-to-video nasty.
