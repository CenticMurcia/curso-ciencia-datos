Although it's impossible to know what went on in the mind of Audrey Marie Hilley as she poisoned those she loved, Judith Light is pretty good in this film. This is so obviously a television movie, since the editing looks like it was done with a meat cleaver, but there are some priceless moments in this film, chiefly among them when Marie, juggling three different identities, "dies" as Robbi and comes back as her platinum-haired twin sister Teri. Introducing herself to Robbi's co-workers is deliciously unbelievable as Teri waltzes into the employee break room and shakes hands with people she already knows. To think that the real Marie Hilley actually tried to pull this off, and successfully convinced a good number of people, is a testament to her charm. Light wisely steers clear of explaining Hilley, instead playing the character straight, letting the absurdity of the story maintain the mystery of Hilley. Not bad for a t.v. movie.
