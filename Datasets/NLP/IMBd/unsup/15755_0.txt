It's not satire, but for all of its absurdity in humor there's an air of sophistication and intelligence. Personally i love this movie and wish they had a soundtrack for it. It's absolutely surreal(but then again maybe thats why i like movies- anything can happen) I think some will find it politically incorrect, but it's not sending any messages for or against any certain "groups"- other than maybe "its wrong to keep girl bands locked up"? thats another reason why i like it- i'm not having an ideal of how i "should" feel about this issue or that group shoved down my throat- its all good clean fun (with killer dolls, a killer clown assistant/spiritual adviser, cute cute business girls, cute rocker girls, a sadistic little person,and a little bit of blood and gore- its a good mix in my opinion.
