STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br /><br />There's wrongs a doin' in Korea, it would seem, where a plan to merge the north and south factions of the country has upset a certain element and a political assassination is rumoured. So Agent Neil Shaw hops on a Korean Air (at least it wasn't Ryan Air!) flight with his partner and tries to stop it. But when a meeting goes bad and he gets framed again, he gets sucked in to another nightmare world of betrayal and red herrings.<br /><br />The first direct to DVD sequel to The Art of War was surprising enough, but this third instalment, featuring the original character from the first two but with a different actor playing him in the shape of the far less charismatic Treach (Today You Die), came out of nowhere. The 18 certificate this time round promises more hard hitting, no holds barred action but the whole thing plays like a bad episode of Mission: Impossible, with a clich√©d script, a banal Brit sidekick, the lamest gunfights ever put on film (where the good guys and bad guys fire at each other in the same way all the time and WITHOUT MOVING AROUND!!!) and a ridiculous, Latino flavoured love scene, all with the random quotes from the great Tsn Zu book coming thick and fast. So sh!t even Wesley Snipes wanted nothing to do with it. Nowadays that's really saying something. *
