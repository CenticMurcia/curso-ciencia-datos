Next time you find a quid down the back of the sofa you could either stroll to the shops for a can of Coke or make Aquanoids 2, I strongly advise the former. Laurence Hobbs gives the kind of script-mangling performance that wouldn't be acceptable in Foggy Bottom Village Hall, never mind a film that people have to spend hard-earned to see. Laura Nativo is pretty, charming and oddly unembarrassed by it all and I can't decide whether Ike and Edwin are awful actors or playing for laughs, let me know guys. Jason Peri's score is far better than the film deserves and the fact that it took two people to write the script is a mystery of the modern age. Good grief. And then some.
