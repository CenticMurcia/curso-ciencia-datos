Doc Jenkins (Willie Nelson)is a prolific Nashville songwriter, it's made him wealthy but bad business decisions and constant partying have left him broke. He then finds out that the rights to the songs he's written have been swindled from him by a Nashville mogul and former business partner (Rip Torn) that he'd signed a songwriting deal with (under the advice of the lawyer the mogul had recommended to Doc).<br /><br />He quits working for the mogul and sets off on a scheme to get his music and money back. With the help of his best friend (Kris Kristofferson), a bank loan (a short term loan on a long term lie), and a beautiful music newcomer (portrayed by Leslie Ann Warren) he starts his own record label and sets off on the road with a record and no money. To make the girl a star he'll use all of the guile and tricks that he'd learned watching the Nashville moguls. He's gonna beat them at their own game.<br /><br />Featuring a lot of great music including "Songwriter" a gem that Willie Nelson fans will love. With both sly and sophomoric humor, Nelson and Kristofferson lead a great cast in a caper-road picture and drag the viewer along for a fun ride.
