This is probably the worst Tori Amos performance I have ever seen. I have seen her live 3 times, and most of her televised performances including her appearances on MTV Unplugged, Hard Rock Live, and PBS. Most of the originals have improvised sections. As a Zeppelin fan I am all for improvisation as long as it adds to, while improving the song. However, her improvisations here do neither. She sings off key on occasion, and the performance seems a little forced. If you want good live Tori get a copy of her performance on Hard Rock Live. Rating: 4/10.
