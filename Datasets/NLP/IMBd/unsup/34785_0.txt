Right from the word go, this movie is dull, flat and full of poor attempts at atmosphere.<br /><br />Jackman's performance is so outstanding compared to the rest of the film it's almost painful to see him leave the shot. Otherwise the film is filled with poorly written, poorly shot performances by actors who seem to be very much aware of just how bad the material they're working with is.<br /><br />While this will probably become a cult classic for those who (rightfully) adore Jackman's work, I have to advise that unless your just dying to see more of Hugh, give it a miss.
