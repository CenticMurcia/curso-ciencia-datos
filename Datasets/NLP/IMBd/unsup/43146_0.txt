Of course Basil Rathbone makes a wonderful Sherlock Holmes, George Zucco is as good as any Moriarty and Ida Lupino is a great victim. While the lovable bumbling Nigel Bruce has come to epitomize Watson, he has nothing in common with heroic Dr. Watson created by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, except maybe that they are both doctors. True fans of Sherlock Holmes can only cringe at Bruce's interpretation.<br /><br />The Plot also has none of the mystery of Sherlock Holmes. Moriarty gives away almost his entire plan at the beginning leaving Holmes without a single deduction that the audience has not already made long before. The true genius of Sherlock Holme's stories is watching Holmes take a number of small clues that lead to implausible deductions which when afterward explained by Holmes seem completely and utterly reasonable. I still wait for the definitive Sherlock Holmes which takes the original stories and makes them as exciting on screen as they are to read. If that is what you are looking for, this movie is a flop.
