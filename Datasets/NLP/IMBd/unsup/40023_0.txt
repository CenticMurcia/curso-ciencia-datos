A pair of newly weds move into the family mansion in the late 18th century but unfortunately new bride Catherine keeps seeing ghostly apparitions and the bad news for her husband is that it usually happens just before she consumates the marriage . This is why sex before marriage is essential nowadays chaps you don`t want a frigid wife screaming before bedtime , during bedtime of course is a different matter . Mind you Catherine does have a cracking pair of lungs so obviously she`s excercised them a lot .<br /><br />But apart from Catherine`s lungs there`s not much in this film that held my interest apart from a few unintentional errors like the obvious stunt man falling down the stairs or the wood cutter who`s the spitting image of Rod Hull . I should also point out - As people have done on this page - that Peter Cushing doesn`t appear untill well into the second half
