I actually love this film but perhaps thats because I grew up in Scotland in the 70's and it does have a lot of "in" jokes which foreign audiences could easily pass by. Sadly, this film was ruined by the completely hideous dubbing. It saddens me that the director allowed this to happen. I know that people say "but we cant understand the accent" well thats their fault, not the films. No one would have dreamed of dubbing Trainspotting so why ruin what is actually a charming and funny movie. Subtitles would have been insulting enough but at least you can turn them off. Yes, the editing is bad and the film quality is grainy but I think that represents the depressed times and the amateurish robbery plot. Perhaps I am over thinking that, maybe they were just being cheap. I don't care, I still love it. Do yourself a favour and watch the original.
