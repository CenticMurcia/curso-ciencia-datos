7 days to live is an OK horror film if you have never seen a horror film before. I have counted at least 5 horror films that this is a mix match of including Amityville horror, The Shining, Maybe a little Misery, Psycho (hey look at that house),Poltergeist. There are very faint glimpses of other films as well. Could have been a lot better with more background on the characters. I would also liked to have seen a lot more detail on where the location is based on this film, it would make it a lot more interesting if the back story on the location was elaborated on then you could get a feel for the where and the why. The ending gave me the feeling that it was left wide open for a sequel because you get no feeling for what happened to the house.
