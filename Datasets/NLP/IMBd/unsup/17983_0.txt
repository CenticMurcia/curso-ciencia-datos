This is probably one of the most funniest movies I've ever seen in my life. I have watched the cartoon here and there when I was a kid and read a few of the comic strips. This movie was excellent.<br /><br />*Spoiler Alert* <br /><br />There are so many funny moments in this film that I just have to name a few: <br /><br />1. Dennis finds Mr. Wilson in bed sick and decides to give him some medicine. So, he sits on Mr. Wilson and aims his slingshot with the aspirin on it at Mr. Wilson's mouth. Well, you can guess what happens next.<br /><br />2. There was one part where Dennis runs away from home and runs into Switchblade Same who was played by Christopher Lloyd. Switchblade Sam attempts to tie up Dennis but Dennis tells him he's doing it wrong and attempts to show him how to tie the knots right by demonstrating it on him. As stupid as the guy is, he allows it. When Dennis is done, the guy can't get free.<br /><br />3. There was the part where he eats an entire pot full of beans. What happens is what made me and my classmates laugh so hard.<br /><br />*End Spoiler* <br /><br />Overall, the movie is very funny. It's sad that they don't make them like this anymore.<br /><br />I give this film 10 stars out of 10. If there were three films that made me laugh the most that were kind of related, the list would look like this: <br /><br />1. Problem Child <br /><br />2. Dennis The Menace <br /><br />3. Home Alone
