Jason Yee stars in this miserable dreck. He also wrote, directed, and produced it, so all the blame falls squarely on his shoulders. Honestly, I couldn't sit through it from beginning to end. I found it so boring I fell asleep about 4 times during the film and missed about half of it (mercifully). Obviously Jason Yee is a talented martial artist and he wanted to showcase his talents in a film. Unfortunately he has no talent as a filmmaker, and he should have stayed in the ring and out of the studio. He has some good moves, but the choreography for the fight scenes is awful. Timing and position are waaaaay off. Sound quality is horrendous and every time there is dialogue it is drowned out by an unwarranted and overloud score. The acting is wooden, stiff, and heartless. The plot is ill-defined and ambiguous. One has no sense of where this story is heading, where it originates, or why it is even being told. Watching this movie is a complete waste of time, unless you happen to be suffering from insomnia.
