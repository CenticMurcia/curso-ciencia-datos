I thought this movie was great. I loved how it all took place during the early 1950s. The atmosphere was down right sensuous, just like the Jazz being played throughout the whole movie. The way Blue is made to undress and is transformed into a different person was very dramatic and really shows the "two shades of blue". I really enjoyed how Blue and the lead guy fell in love and I liked how Sully tried to protect Blue. I didn't like the part where JJ Clark showed up at the brothel and Blue screamed, she looked really stupid. This is the only part of the movie I didn't like. I don't know why people think its a bad movie, I own it and watch it regularly.
