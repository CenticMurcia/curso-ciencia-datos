Roger Moore's turn as Rufus Excalibur ffolkes is one of his best performances. He made the film in between Bonds (Moonraker & For Your Eyes Only) and wow - what a film! Anthony Perkins is great as the creepy terrorist Lou Kramer and he is very odd indeed - a great role for him! The whole North Sea idea is cool and I just cannot comment enough on how great this film is. You even get James Mason as a salty British Captain who assists in stopping the hijackers of an oil rig! Great cast - great effects - great everything! I highly recommend this film as it changed my life when I saw it as a boy! And that's why I wanted to work on an oil rig - cuz of ffolkes!!!
