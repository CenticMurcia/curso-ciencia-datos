This was classic Sharpe and classic Sean Bean. Combining Bernard Cornwell's original three books set in India into one Sharpe film, and resetting it after the battle of Waterloo has done nothing to detract from the enjoyment I had from the latest adventures of Richard Sharpe. The plot has taken my favourite bits from all three books and melded them into a fast paced and exciting film.<br /><br />The acting from both Sean Bean and Daragh O'Malley is up to its usual high standard and is laced with the timing and sardonic wit that has made the previous Sharpe films such a success. Toby Stephens as General Dodd also puts in an admirable and believable performance, and to his credit he had me disliking his character also immediately. The film has some of the best special effects that I have seen from the Sharpe films, especially the storming of the breach sequence and the blowing of the mine. I think some credit should also go to the stunt performers and extras as the effort with which they throw themselves around the set adds to the action segments and makes them much more enjoyable.<br /><br />The only thing that I can possibly think that would detract from all the praise I have for this film would be the over showing of Lucy Brown's bosom which, although perfectly lovely and appreciated, was overall probably a tad unnecessary. Personally I just felt that there wasn't much need for it plot wise, and it was only there to titillate (excuse the pun)and sensationalise.<br /><br />I have seen and read all that is Sharpe and can honestly say that this is one of the best Sharpe films. It will be appreciated by old and new fans alike. Hopefully we will get to see some of the other books that haven't yet made it to film produced now. Fingers crossed!
