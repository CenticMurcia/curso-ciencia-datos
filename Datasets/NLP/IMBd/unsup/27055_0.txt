There used to be a certain naivety in low-budget horror back in, oh, maybe the 70's & 80's. A film could be earnest and yet not very good, and perhaps with some unintentional entertainment value (like laughs). Seems like those days are gone forever as up-and-coming "directors" can turn out seemingly "serious" horror movies, like this, at the drop of a hat, and get them released on an unsuspecting public. Be warned, this is a real piece of work.<br /><br />Perhaps the makers of this film WERE earnest in their efforts, but the acting is terrible and the characters are unconvincing, like the tough blond police officer and the drunken retired ex-cop that team up to catch the perpetrator in this film.<br /><br />The story is that young kids are getting killed in grisly ways by some Leatherface-looking killer, who may be an escaped mental patient. Suspicion falls on the janitor at the high school though, mainly because he's big & weird. He plays with dolls, & "Rock-em Sock-em Robots" with kids faces taped on. He also pretends to be a rock star & sticks pins in dolls, etc. The tough and potty-mouthed police officer then eases up and teams up on the potty-mouthed ex-cop & they set out to find the killer. The red herrings in this film are practically thrown into your lap, or perhaps your face.<br /><br />There are some scenes in this film that make you wonder if this was intended as a horror-comedy, but it's pretty difficult to say. The film really doesn't work on either level. Overall this is generally uninvolving and it just plays on until you either finish watching it or rip it out of the player & go to bed before it's over, like I did. Maybe the killer wasn't who it seemed to be and there was some great twist to it. Can I live without knowing this? You betcha. 1 out of 10.
