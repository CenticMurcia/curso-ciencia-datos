The Twins are growing up and are doing quite well for them selves. Lets not forget the pressure teen actors/actresses are under. They have been involved in TV series and movies almost from the day they were born. We all know how much pressure Hollywood can put on these young performers. Overall I give the Olsen Twins a 10. You don't find many movies these days that are clean cut. No sex or violence and no swearing which has to be a first these days. Lets not forget these girls are still very young and as they make or get into more movies there acting skills will only improve, but still they deserve a lot of credit. I'd like to see them make more movies and keep that clean cut image, which is very hard to find these days.........
