Saawariya is not your typical dancing around trees romance but a mood piece exploring nostalgia, melodrama, loss, loneliness and love in various forms - first love, obsessive love, physical love, and heartbreak. <br /><br />The movie is directed by one of the last few auteur's of Indian cinema who imbues it with his expansive vision . Bhansali's unmistakable imprint is all over this work. He obviously feels great kinship for Hindi movies and characters of the 50's and 60's and takes elements from those films and combines them with a Moulin Rouge inspired mies-en-scene where old fashioned pimps and contemporary prostitutes with retro hairstyles congregate in a studio generated Muslim ghetto to create a cinematic landscape all his own. While the directors cinematic landscape may be off putting to some, this viewer bought it hook line and sinker! I can almost see Johnny Walker in the role of the front desk clerk at the seedy Momin Lodge in Oldtown and the casting of Begum Para definitely adds an element of credibility to the proceedings. Zohra Sehgal never ceases to amaze and the perfect casting for this movie sets the table for the deliciously angst-filled four course meal the director serves for us. <br /><br />This timeless, nameless place befit a film that is grounded in abstract and existential themes rather than plot as the women characters are caught up in an endless cycle of waiting Â– Lollipop for her son, Sakina's grandmother for her tenants and her own son, and Sakina for her lover. <br /><br />The central character is Ranbir Raj, a throwback to Raj Kapoor's persona from the 50s' - the lovable tramp, a bit of a goof-ball, who usually gets his heart broken.. There are many references to this , from the bowler hat to the umbrella . Ranbir does do a very good job portraying the complex emotional arc of his character from the "thunderbolt" of love at first sight to unrequited love. Sonam bears more than a passing resemblance to Waheeda Rehman in this film, especially the Waheeda from Chaudvin ka Chand and her character seems to be a direct inspiration for Sakina in this film, as she obsessively waits for her lover to return. Sonam has a complex many layered role, and she comes through in a more than adequate manner, considering that this is her first movie. Salman is an appropriate object of desire in his brief appearance and Rani steals the show with her clever one liners. <br /><br />The music is melodious and woven easily into the film. It is truly a concept album, reflecting the various shades of love, from the dizzying heights of first love (Masha Allah, Jab SE Tere), to playful romance (Thode badmaash) ,to intense romance (Yoon shabnami, Jaan-e Jaan) to heartbreak( Daras bina nahin) .The many years spent on perfecting this soundtrack show and how! The fantastic and poignant song "Pari" which is beautifully pasteurized on the ladies of the night stands out in particular. <br /><br />Of course, the movie is visually spectacular with many "Bhansali" moments. The lighting and cinematography is entirely suited to the theme , mood and atmosphere of the movie. At times the pacing is decidedly slow but just at the right moment, the movie picks up. A special mention should be made of the lyrical quality of the parting scene between the two protagonists. Ranbir and Sonam handled this scene beautifully, both with words said and unsaid . The ending could easily have become a maudlin affair, but it was genuinely affecting leaving a bittersweet aftertaste. <br /><br />The movie recalls the slow languid pace, the claustrophobia and language of the Muslim culture of days gone by. I think this is Bhansali's homage to the era of Kamal Amrohi and Gurudutt. Nobody makes movies like this anymore and I applaud Mr. Bhansali for having the courage and conviction to stick to his vision. <br /><br />I am sure most of the regular desi junta will not get this movie, but , oh well, its their loss.<br /><br />Like someone said in an earlier review, this is destined to be a desi post modern cult classic!
