"Nostalgia" is very often a catchphrase that means "how we wish things had been." That goes for everybody, whether or not you actually lived in the times you're looking back on -- and this is a fact that seems very clear to the makers of MAN OF THE CENTURY. It's a smart film that includes all the beats of both modern independent romantic comedies and classic films, but it never tries to convince you that the world of Johnny Twennies is anything like the real world... in the 1920s or the 1990s. Instead, it's a world of fantasy pretending to be the real world, with just a thin layer of verisimilitude on top of the proverbial cake. Everyone is perfect, from the "realistic" gangsters to Frank Gorshin's hilarious cameo, but the clear best in show is Gibson Frazier. Frazier is note-perfect as Johnny, and he commands the screen from start to finish with both his own solid performance and high charisma and shrewd tributes to Harold Lloyd and Buster Keaton. This movie's a winner, and I for one would love to see more work from Frazier on the movie screen.
