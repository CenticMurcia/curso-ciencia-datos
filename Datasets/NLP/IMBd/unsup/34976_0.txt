This one is the one to miss folks.<br /><br />Not even the great one himself (Christopher Walken) could save this one. The lead character is at best painful to watch. Maggie Q was the only reason for me staying through the show. Stunning woman that Maggie. George Lopez, leave this OFF your resume there George. And for Jason Scott Lee to be in this show is reason enough for some intervention and immediate rehab! Get some help Jason!! I remember laughing once during the movie. Don't remember which part either. Sad sad sad. Previews are silly yes, but the movie isn't. Shhhhhocking!<br /><br />Anyhow ladies and gents I am only writing more on this subject due to not using enough lines and comments. Thank you IMDb. Now we must all bare the burden of reading the rantings of someone who went to this movie on his only day off this week and kiss $4.50 good bye. Not to mention an hour and a half I'll never get back. And who are these other people who did the other reviews that thought this eyeball burner was "hilarious"? Must be the director or producer. And if it takes 3 film companies to produce a movie, man you're in for a rough ride already. Hope I now used enough space so I can submit. Take care all.
