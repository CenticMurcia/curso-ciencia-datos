I saw this film at the Union Square screening and was simply thrilled to see a film for people over 35 years old. WE STILL GO TO THE MOVIES! I saw this with my sister who is getting up there (okay she's 48..Sorry :) We both had tears in our eyes at the end. To sit in audience and have this experience go on a ride that has adult characters going through real situations. Who decided to kill this for us?? They've already killed CBS FM what's next?! We have DVD players too! I love my Netflix account. This pushing us out to pasture while the fart joke movies dominate makes me sick. I still want to go to movies. This movie had such a warm natural cadence. Jane Curtin and Danny Aiello were simply a real married couple that have been through a good deal of sh** together. They still had love but a past that showed many bumps, many choices and all in their eye contact. It was a wonderful ride with a REAL FAMILY! Felt like mine but Italian not French/ Irish!! :)
