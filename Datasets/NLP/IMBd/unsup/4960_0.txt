I saw this film at a New York film festival and was pleasantly surprised. "101 Ways" is what "Reality Bites" should have been. An interesting, tightly-knit, witty comedy from a female point-of-view. Just when you think it is headed for a cliche, the film takes a turn and surprises the audience. Very impressive debut. BTW, this film deserves theatrical distribution but even if it doesn't get it, I'm sure it will build quite a cult following on video and cable.
