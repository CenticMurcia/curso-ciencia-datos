I have only seen about fifteen minutes of this show and that wasn't by choice. It was on the television when I visited someone in the hospital. It was a perfect place for the show, it, like the person I was visting was sick. It was trying to get laughts, but the only ones that were laughting were on the laugh track. It is such a standard, generic sit-com with nothing new and little to recommend it. I have never understood why it is felt that certain actors "deserve" a show.<br /><br />It seems to me that the first thing that should be developed is a concept, something new and different. Then the actors should be cast. This show appears to be a vehicle for Brad Garrett, who's talents I think are very limited. He might be fine as a supporting character, but seems to lack the talent to be a primary character.
