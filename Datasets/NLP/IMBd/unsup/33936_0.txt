i am not sure with what intention the movie is made.. It resembles to cannibal apocalypse (another ridiculous movie)in the sense of its treatment and cheap thrills. On the other hand it shows up naked women without any reason in it's frames.<br /><br />the acting, plot, cinematography, screenplay is obviously, missing and you hope that the pathetic background score should have been missing instead. It is that bad. On the acting front, their are just a couple of seconds when you would see some acting on the screen and that is by the warden. when the leading lady prisoner undresses and approaches her, its the look in her eyes which makes you think that a good actress have been wasted.<br /><br />The effort is so bad that that it get stck up in ur brain as if a chewing gum stuck in hair!!! quite frankly, if u want to show women's bodies and make money, then do just that n do it in a way which makes the experience worth enjoying.. or if u want to show the prison life, show it with some empathy and sincerity.
