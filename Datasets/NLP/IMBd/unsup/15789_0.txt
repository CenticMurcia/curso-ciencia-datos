I'd have to agree with the previous reviewer who has pointed out that most of those who will watch this film are already on board with its powerful argument against discrimination. Yet that's no fault of the film itself -- and maybe, just maybe, it will stick around and change a few minds. Mr. Karslake and Ms. Mendoza have my tremendous respect.<br /><br />Tomorrow, my state will vote on whether we will or will not cancel the right of two men or two women to marry, in the form of a constitutional amendment. It will be agonizingly close. After catching it at Sundance, I watched this film again last night in the comfort of my home, just to remind myself of what's at stake.<br /><br />One way or another, the tide is turning. It will not be an easy win, but nothing worth fighting for ever is.
