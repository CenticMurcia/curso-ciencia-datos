In my opinion,this is the worst slasher movie ever made.The creators fill this trash with nothing,but long cliches.No suspense,no gore,just miserable jokes and very annoying characters.The killings are stupid,the music is garbage and the acting absolutely sucks.Even "Slaughter High" is a bit better than this piece of crap.Please,don't waste your time-you'll be sorely disappointed.
