Saw it on TV yesterday or the day before. I found it a passable time waster with the usual ingredients:<br /><br />1. Whatever number son is involved, he always wants to join his father on the case, Charlie insults him and eventually has to rescue him.<br /><br />2. There is almost always a frightened black sidekick and Mantan Moreland is, in this regard, one of the successors to Step'n Fetchit.<br /><br />Eddie Anderson and Willie Best played similar parts in various movies, not always Charlie's. Mildly racist and condescending.<br /><br />3. Charlie always has a supply of aphorisms at the ready. No real mystery involved and not a Charlie Chan at the Opera. But<br /><br />not bad, though one could write the film oneself.<br /><br />** out of ****.
