PBS made two great mini-series on "The Forsyte Saga" in 1968 and 2002. MGM made a good movie, too, about the Forsytes; they called it "That Forsyte Woman". It is a shorter version, but tells the story perfectly.<br /><br />Casting Robin Hood (Errol Flynn) for Soames Forsyte is very creative, but it worked. This is Mr. Flynn's best performance. Greer Garson plays Soames beautiful but suffering wife, Irene. The chemistry between them makes the movie work. Too bad these great friends never worked again. <br /><br />What does not work is Robert Young as Philip Bosinney. He was the wrong type and accent. The director should have hired an English actor for the Bosinney role. <br /><br />The color scheme of the movie is black and white, but it is filmed in color. That is distracting! It is a black and white story. However, the movie is still interesting and it moves quickly.
