This film is really crap. Pierce Brosnan, who is a good actor, plays an American tough guy who has problems in his marriage. He works as a bomb expert who runs into the man (ron silver) who is cheating on him with his wife. This is the basic storyline and the fact that he is tracking a group of terrorists is completely in the shadow of this terrible script.<br /><br />If you like Pierce Brosnan, but hate bad movies it is okay to skip this one
