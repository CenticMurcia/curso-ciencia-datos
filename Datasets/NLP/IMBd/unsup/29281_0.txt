This was probably one of the best in a long time. I like the miniature killer, but this was way more fun ... if one can say death can be fun. The Devil from Constantine makes a great Pimp. Don't know who the old Poet or the main Pleasure provider were but they did great. The voice over in the snake scene was very well done. I was touched personally by just a few moments of screen time, Wish I could remember who the actress was. Had a hard time with the "madam," she did well with what she had, winking & all that, but I just didn't know quite what to make of her. When I see it again I am sure I will get a lot more out of her work, but the first time through it was tough. She was in probably the best scene in the movie, when they were sampling her DNA, the thing with the cigarette, Magnificent.<br /><br />Over all I gotta say the boxer had a bad day.
