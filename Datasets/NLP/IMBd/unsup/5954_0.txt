I am an avid player of the "Resident Evil" video game and I have to say they did an excellent job making the movie from the games. A lot of people who play the games may be disappointed because the movie isn't 100% like the game. Well all I have to say to that is "GET OVER IT"! The movie was fantastic and Milla Jovovich was terrific. I hope enough people go and see this so they will make a sequel. I would be disappointed if people didn't go and see this movie just because its based off a video game. That would be a mistake!!<br /><br />
