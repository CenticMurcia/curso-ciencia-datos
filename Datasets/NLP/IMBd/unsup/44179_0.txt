Doesn't it bother anybody that the movie's producers kill off the star of the first movie within the first 10 minutes? If his death meant something for the movie, fine. But during the rest of the movie, it really doesn't come back up!<br /><br />Never mind that the "Migs" were actually F-4's. Sheez.
