At first the idea of of a world where "gay" is normal and "straight" is "perverted" seemed silly but interesting.<br /><br />A few minutes into the film you start to think "why am I wasting a minute of my life on this rubbish?". The story is so contrived and the alleged acting by everyone is so wooden it almost defies description. It's been a long time since I have seen such poor performances.<br /><br />The movie has no idea what it wants to be - social comment? comedy ? farce ? drama? and fails miserably in every aspect.<br /><br />The ending says it all for the whole storyline - a complete and total disappointment. I really think that all involved should be ashamed of this abysmal piece of cinema and I doubt if many involved would want to show it on their CV for future work.
