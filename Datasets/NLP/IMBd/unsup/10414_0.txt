When I first saw this film I had the feeling something completely new was achieved by the film maker. An Action Sci-fi movie with action scenes that are believable (humanly possible) but still with a mysterious, powerful alien that is slowly developed from a computer generated wispy creature to a real and frightening being. Yes, the alien has superhuman strength, abilities and equipment but remains believable. Yes, Arnold rolls his muscles but not too explicitly as in some of his other movies, besides he needs them all in the physical fight against the alien who is very clearly a size too big for Ernie. In summary, a fast, innovative Action Sci-fi movie so full with small detail that you can see it time after time and still discover something new.
