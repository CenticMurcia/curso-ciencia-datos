After the end of the United States Civil War, the recovering nation turns to the building of the unsettled west. Handsome young Irish immigrant Errol Flynn (as Wade Hatton) arrives in Dodge City, Kansas, to help. But, cattleman Flynn finds the wealthy city is controlled by lawless Bruce Cabot (as Jeff Surrett), an old enemy. Due to Mr. Cabot's presence, a young boy is horrifically killed during one of the town's frequent shoot-ups; so, Flynn decides accept a Sheriff's position, and rid the town of its rats.<br /><br />Beautiful Olivia de Havilland (as Abbie Irving) provides romantic interest, although Flynn gets off on the wrong foot by helping cause the death of her brother (William Lundigan). Saloon singer Ann Sheridan (as Ruby Gilman) and brawling Guinn "Big Boy" Williams (as Tex Baird) are among the others making fine impressions, in this richly produced Warner Brothers western. The direction (Michael Curtiz) and Technicolor cinematography (Sol Polito) combine for some outstanding scenes and images.<br /><br />******** Dodge City (4/1/39) Michael Curtiz ~ Errol Flynn, Olivia de Havilland, Bruce Cabot, Ann Sheridan
