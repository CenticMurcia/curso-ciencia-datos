The first two "Candyman" films were interesting, well paced horror films. This one is just empty trash made by some greedy producer. Nothing new is added to the storyline, and in fact, things explained in the previous one get butchered up, to a bad effect. No explanation is given as to why the Candyman returns either, nor what the heck he is doing in LA all of the sudden. Phillip Glass's creepy little score also disappears. Instead, what we do get is the director making some glaring mistakes when he was aiming for some gory scene, no real sense of horror, a nonsensical plotline, the same type of cheap film used for most late night Cinemax flicks, several pointless lines, bad twists, and a lead actress with gigantic breasts who wears a tight shirt and no bra at all times. WHY?<br /><br />Not an awful or annoying movie, just a very flat one. You are not missing anything...
