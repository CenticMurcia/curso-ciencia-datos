Man, I loved Tenspeed and Brownshoe so much when it came out. Jeff Goldblum was awesome and cute in portraying his character's naivet√© while Vereen showed his comic side very well with the witty dialog all the actors were blessed to perform . I really enjoyed the counter-play between Vereen's character and his parole officer. Lots of comedic tension there. <br /><br />My favorite episode was a spoof on Treasure of the Sierra Madre and there were plenty of winks in the direction of Looney Tunes with the tossing around of the lit dynamite. That was one of the funniest moments of that show.<br /><br />There seriously needs to be a DVD release of this sadly underrated show. I think the time is right for it to find a new audience.
