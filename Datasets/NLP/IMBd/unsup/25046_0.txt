This film took me by surprise - I confess I was expecting yet another low-budget-low-interest indie flick, but Kisses & Caroms doesn't fall in such category.<br /><br />This independent gem tells the story of a girl who setup a threesome with her ex to show him she's still the best. Perfect excuse to make a sex film, right? Well don't worry it goes far beyond that, and the film explores with humor and no boundaries men vs. women somewhat tumultuous relationships.<br /><br />The cast deliver an outstanding performance, making their characters to be believable, and thanks to well-written dialogs and effective storytelling, Kisses & Caroms is a pleasure to watch. Add to this a great production value, sexy babes - including cult icon Ginger Lynn Allen - and topped with a great score, all this will make you wonder if the film is truly a low-budget production... Kisses and Caroms is guaranteed to keep you away from the Fast Forward button of your remote control.
