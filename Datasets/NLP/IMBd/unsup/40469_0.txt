Sailing from the United States to London, chivalrous Leslie Fenton (as Barry Wilding) saves pretty Muriel Evans (as Julie Kenmore) from the advances of brutish Matty Kemp. The lady is grateful, but rejects Mr. Fenton's more mannered advances. After debarking, Fenton learns he has inherited a deceased uncle's estate. But, when he visits his mansion, Fenton is chased off the property, by interloping inhabitants. Surprisingly, Ms. Evans (the woman he saved on the ship) is among the uninvited tenants. During the running time, you go from wondering what's happening in "The House of Secrets", to indifference. Fenton and a good cast, including pal Sidney Blackmer (as Tom Starr), try to keep it simmering.<br /><br />**** The House of Secrets (10/28/36) Roland D.
