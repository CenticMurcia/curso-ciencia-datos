As an ardent "scholar" of B-movies, I found particular delight when happening upon this little piece. Unintentional humor being the requisite hallmark of any "good" B-movie, this film has plenty of it. Dialogue and acting that borders on the truly comedic, ill-defined meandering characters, loads of unexplained shots, scenes, and material-this is not the "best" B-movie I have seen, but it is entertaining nonetheless. The effects are perhaps the most overtly amateurish aspect of the film, and sure to get the biggest laughs (especially the end). But a discerning viewer will find more humor in the dialogue and acting (read: Gosset Jr.), vague characters (read: the British/Australian/Whatever shark killers/photographers), and terribly edited action. So, for B-movie fans, I give this a 3 out of 5.
