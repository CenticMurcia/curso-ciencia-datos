This film was a remarkable look into the life of an artist known as Crumb. This film shows us that perversion, loneliness, desperation, drug abuse, suicide and genus can all survive in one "unique" family. I loved this film because it shows life on the other end of the spectrum. Many movies are glamorous and exciting, where this movie is real, honest, dysfunctional and bizarre. The film is a display of Crumb's art work as well as him home town and family. This documentary shows that dark dismal conditions (completly contrary to the normal and healthy conditions of a "good person")of Robert Crumb lead him to alternate and original ideas. His unique world view is enlightening and explanatory. I loved this film because it was a vacation into darkness and creativity, and a vacation from the average film experience.
