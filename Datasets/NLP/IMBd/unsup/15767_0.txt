I have only seen this movie once, and it was some time ago so I do not remember it too clearly. From what I do remember it was good. This one has a gal reading this book about a guy who is killing people for their body parts to impress the woman he loves. The strange thing is though, people are turning up dead and they are dying just as it was written in book. If that isn't strange enough seems the guy who wrote the book was a bit crazy and he even went so far as to say the book was not a work of fiction, but rather a true story. He said this of another book he wrote as well. This one is rather good, but the ending is a bit strange as something from his other book comes true too. If I ever got the chance I would love to see it again because it was most definitely worth a look.
