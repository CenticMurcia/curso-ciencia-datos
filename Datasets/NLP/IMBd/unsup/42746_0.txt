Richard Sachs (if you didn't even chuckles at that name, the ill-conceived 'humor' in this horror film will bore you, by the way), the collage student son of a successful businessman decides to have the inaugural debut of his reality show website shoot at an haunted house that was home of serial killer Sean McIntyre, a man who killed his family one Thanksgiving night before hanging himself. Of course he comes back to stalk the six contests of the game.<br /><br />This film was horrible in just about every way, with the acting being atrocious (even for the low standard of low-budget horror films of the ilk), the humor was mind-stunning bad and the 'action' came too little too late to really give a damn about it. A sub-par clone of just about any indistinguishable straight to DVD slasher flick out there today. Pass on it <br /><br />My Grade: F <br /><br />Eye Candy: Sara Christal, Krista Grotte, and Anne McDaniels all show breasts
