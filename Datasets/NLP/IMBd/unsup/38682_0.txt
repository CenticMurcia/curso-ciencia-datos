Nails, directed by Russian Andrey Iskanov, is about a hit-man unable to cope with the daily life. The leading character tries Vodka and pills but nothing will do the trick. At one time, unable to sleep, he stumbles on a magazine that inspires him to drive nails through the brain. And that's basically it. The first part of the movie is rather good - grey sweeping footage over suburbia accompanied by monotone instrumental music sets the mood effectively. A mood-setter is also the fact that there is no dialog in this part of the movie either, almost like an old journal film. However, as the film progresses the story gets old. The running time is about 1 hour which is about 30 minutes too long. The FX are not very convincing, although may be unpleasant for the casual horror fan. <br /><br />If you want gore you'll probably will be disappointed. However, if you want surrealism, you'll probably like it a lot. Myself, I like my horror horrifying and my gore extreme. If I want surrealism a prefer other genres.
