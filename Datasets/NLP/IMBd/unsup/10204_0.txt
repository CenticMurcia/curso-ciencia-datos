Recent horror films seem more inclined to thrill than to chill. Such hits like "Dawn of Dead" and "I am Legend" are great movies, but their fear comes from intensity rather than dread. However, there have been a few good chillers out there, such as "The Others" and "The Ring." And now, "The Orphanage," from acclaimed Spanish producer Guillermo del Toro, creeps its way into their ranks, while still being a genre-defying film.<br /><br />The story revolves around Laura, a woman who buys her childhood home in hopes of starting an orphanage for handicapped children with her husband Carlos. But soon their son Simón starts communicating with the orphans who used to live there. Thus, many spooky-doins' begin. And boy are they spooky. "The Orphanage" is certainly not the first film to use the "creepy kids" angle, but screenwriter Sergio Sánchez made the story original and engrossing enough to be wholly enjoyable.<br /><br />One of the creepiest factors of "The Orphanage" is its sound design. The house contains plentiful creaks and groans, which seem to come standard in all haunted houses, but the real frights come from the music. As well as being ambrosial to the ears, it has the power to induce an assortment of emotions. It can bring a tear to your eye, or make you cramp up in your seat from suspense.<br /><br />But the real enjoyment comes from the acting. Horror films are known for having some of the campiest acting out of all the film genres, but "The Orphanage" is one of those rare gems where the actors are so great they make you think, "Yeah, maybe they really are experiencing supernatural phenomena." And Kudos to Belén Rueda (Laura) for having the most range and believability in the entire movie. Her performance transcends the language barrier and makes you forget you're reading subtitles.<br /><br />To round out the film is the cinematography, and if Guillermo del Toro is involved, you know it will be stylish to the max. The manor-like orphanage is not the typical run-down creepy haunted house. It isn't so much haunting as it is hauntingly beautiful. And each of the places around it follow, suit such as the beach and the playground. Each scene is so elegant that it can be incredibly terrifying while still being gorgeously shot at the same time.<br /><br />Of course, "The Orphanage" isn't perfect. One of its weakest points is that it is a bit cliché. There are a bunch or creepy kids, there is a medium that contacts the dead, and, gosh, does that house ever shut-up? But with all that aside, "The Orphanage" is still a classy and mysterious haunted house movie that will keep you guessing (and screaming) until the end. Do yourself a favor and go see this film despite the subtitles.
