I'm so sorry to write a totally negative critique on this film, but I have to be honest about it: the whoooooole story is foreseeable, there is not the tiniest surprise or change of plan. the acting is more or less 2nd class; you wouldn't believe one of the "criminals" are more than "want-to-be-good" actors in cheap clothing (I know: the cheap clothing is part of their characters.. you know what I mean!).<br /><br />At least occasionally it was a liiiittle bit funny, but most of the jokes were just too flat.<br /><br />Do you know the feeling, when you'd like to turn the clock back to the moment you came home from work and decide what to do with your "rare" sparetime? <br /><br />Sorry, again. I tried.<br /><br />love & peace
