This film is a total brain-fart. I think I got 'special' whilst watching this film. It makes no sense, at all, ever. The special effects include a sliding screen and a large quantity of Vaseline. If you ever feel depressed about the state of your own life - FEAR NOT - it could be worse. You could be in this film ..or watching it. The leading lady has no facial expressions, the leading man on the other hand will not quit moving his damn eyebrows! ITS VERY DISTRACTING FROM THE INCREDIBLE STORYLINE ..as is a tiny hole in his tee shirt. Change your goddamn shirt beefcake. Best quote: (from the other room) - *AHHHHHHHHHHH* Hefty lady - That was a scream.<br /><br />I'm lost for words.
