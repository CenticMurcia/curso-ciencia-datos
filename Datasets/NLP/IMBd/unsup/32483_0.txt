The only reason this got made was because the businessmen behind it (I refuse to call them film-makers)knew they could secure a DVD deal in the States. They are nothing more than Greek Uwe Bolls.<br /><br />It's the worst-directed, worst-scripted, worst-acted, worst-lit, worst-scored movie I've ever seen. <br /><br />It's hackneyed, nonsensical and features some of the most obnoxious characters ever.<br /><br />I would call it cinematic vomit but I feel uneasy to have the word cinematic associated with this turd, even under this context.<br /><br />Since the minimum length for comments is 10 lines of text, all I can add is this stinks,this stinks,this stinks,this stinks,this stinks,this stinks,this stinks,this stinks,this stinks,this stinks,this stinks,this stinks.
