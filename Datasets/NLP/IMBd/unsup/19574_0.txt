One of the smartest movies to come along in a great while, it's also very funny. Beatty's transformation from a suicidal senator on a campaign trail he no longer cares about to the life loving man who embraces urban hip-hop culture to the hilt is great. The best comedic moments are when Beatty is in his "rapper" mode, speaking in rhymes at campaign functions and tv interviews. A really great movie, you won't be disappointed.
