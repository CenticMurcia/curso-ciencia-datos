Jack fails to save a survivor from drowning and then begins to see visions of his dead father. He wanders off into the woods and almost dies. Locke saves him but tells him to stay the journey, and to find closure. Locke then goes off to kill some more game. What Jack ultimately finds is an empty coffin and a source of water, which the survivor's are now out of. He returns to the beach, stronger than before and definitely in command. Flashbacks reveal his tortured relationship with his father, who died of heart failure while visiting down under. The business with dad is played out a little too long, for my tastes. Otherwise, a heck of an episode.
