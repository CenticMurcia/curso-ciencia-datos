A story of a twin trapeze act who fall out over a winning lottery ticket and a girl. A wonderful story and cast with an unusual and unpredictable end. This is my favourite film of all time and the brilliant Herbert Lom gives his best performance to date as Jules and Georges. I definitely recommend it.10/10
