This "movie" is an AR launch point for "pit bull" haters. They show both extremes; the dumbest wanna-be dogfighters in the planet vs. greenie SPCA/HS officers, neither of which know or understand the APBT at all. They associate ALL dogfighting with drugs, gangsters and other forms of violence and make the casual dog owner look like a saint. There are millions of registered APBT's and AmStaff's in the U.S. and maybe 3 deaths a year. My dogs have been bit by more labs and shepherds than anything else. This movie is completely biased towards the Humane Societies AR views and it is an attempt to get common people "educated" that pitbulls are all inherently dog aggressive and those who own them do so for a tough appearance. My APBT's are ALL BIG BABIES, not a vicious bone in their bodies and they win weightpull and SchH events every month. These dogs are no more likely to fight then any other dog and dogfighting has only been part of breeding programs for the last 200 years. These dogs have been around for over 2,000 years! Don't let this movie be an excuse for the SPCA/Humane Society to put down "trained to fight" dogs. Most of these dogs are left for dead because they REFUSE to fight at all! And the SPCA/HS still put them down... this movie is total, twisted garbage. Save your money and read a book.
