This is a disaster movie from director Ronald Neame (The Poseidon Adventure), but the real disaster is just how much this film sucks. Basically a comet/asteroid/meteor (whatever you want to call it) is heading for a collision for Earth, and obviously it could extinguish mankind if it hits. So the authorities want to combine the nuclear capabilities of both theirs and Russia's fire power to destroy the rock. People involved in the mission, in whatever way, are Dr. Paul Bradley (Sir Sean Connery), Tatiana Nikolaevna Donskaya (Natalie Wood), NASA's Harry Sherwood (Karl Malden), Dr. Alexei Dubov (Brian Keith) and Maj. Gen. Adlon (Martin Landau). Also starring Trevor Howard as Sir Michael Hughes, Richard Dysart as Secretary of Defense, Henry Fonda as the President and Roger Robinson as Hunter. What makes this film so awful is there is hardly any effort in the acting, well, they kept their faces straight. There's that ridiculous scene where everyone is getting covered in mud in the subway, and all the model rockets and the rock are not convincing enough, because you can tell their models, especially with the crappy explosions. Just one of the most terrible films I have ever seen. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Sound (it shouldn't have been nominated for any!). Very poor!
