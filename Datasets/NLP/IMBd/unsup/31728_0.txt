I love this series, it's such a feelgood programme. I really wish life could always turn out Perfick, like it does for the Larkins! What I love about them, especially Pop, is their irrepressible joy in life and ability to see the best in every situation. Pop can turn a wet miserable weekend into a joyous romp by sheer force of personality. Wonderful.<br /><br />(Someone from USA said this on this comments page; "We saw an episode on TV the other day and Peter Jackson got a director credit, but I don't see him listed here or this series listed on Jackson's page. The credits show several directors and it seems to be common practice to have guest directors." I think they're thinking of a different Peter Jackson, the well-known director. The cinematography on this series was done by a Peter Jackson, which is a pretty common name I suppose.)
