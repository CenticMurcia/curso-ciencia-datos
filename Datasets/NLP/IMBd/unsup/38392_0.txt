A bad day of movies. First, it's Dreamcatcher, which I couldn't even stand the last twenty minutes of. Now this! This is a chick flick, full of brainless nobodies (besides Perabo, what's she doin in this?), and it's a comedy. But with no laughs. The most hilarious moment would have probably been an unfunny catfight. So, this is definitely one to avoid. AVOID.
