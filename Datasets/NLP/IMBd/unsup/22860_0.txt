Tobe Hooper is one of my favorite filmmakers. Even though his track record of churning out great movies is definitely uneven, there's always something about his films, good or bad, that I like. The quirkiness of his characters, the wild situations, or his style of direction. Unfortunately, I'M DANGEROUS TONIGHT has NONE of these Tobe Hooper qualities. It's totally bland and pretty much forgettable. And in my book, this, along with CROCODILE, is probably his worst movie ever. <br /><br />The idea for the story is great and had so much potential but once the fabric is turned into a dress, the story goes nowhere...fast. There's almost no violence in it. The only scene with any interesting action occurs when the woman freaks out and strangles her boyfriend.<br /><br />Anthony Perkins' character is totally useless. He was hired just so they can have his name on the video box. And the scenes with Natalie Schafer are very difficult to watch because it's so sad to see her in such a terrible state. MÃ¤dchen Amick is the only interesting actor in this unremarkable "horror" movie, but even her character is bland and wimpy.<br /><br />Even Tobe Hooper completists shouldn't bother watching this.
