i guess i'm getting to the nostalgic stage in life,and Then Came Bronson is something that readily comes to mind.definitely a show of it's time,it surely borrowed from other shows(Route 66?)but added it's own touch in great writing and acting(Michael Parks).speaking of him,i thought he had disappeared from the planet,but his IMDb resume says differently.Parks difficulties with the shows producers probably caused the series early demise,and that's a pity.watching the show as a kid,i was fascinated that this guy could just pick up and move on at will(whereas i was forced to go to school),on a search to find out something about himself.this probably couldn't be made in todays world,nor should it be.you can't improve on perfection.
