The movie is a good entertainer. It is a portrayal of Asoka as a normal human being rather than a great king who stands out from normal people. And as much is not recorded abt his life, the director has taken the liberty to make it like a fairy tale. And he has done it amazingly well! The things that stand out are the breathtaking scenes and the acting. Santhosh has proved yet again why he is the best cinematographer in India. The role of asoka in this movie required someone with a wide range of acting skills, to portray the different shades of the character(asoka), as he progress through his life. SRK, one of the few who could have done it, has carried out his task with perfection! Its also very interesting to note how well the fight sequences have been taken. I never expected the war scenes to be of this standard in a bollywood movie.
