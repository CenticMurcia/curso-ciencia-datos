David Zucker is a true legend in a spoof horror films. He can make you laugh from everything, that he filmed. "Scary Movie 3" was a huge bomb in parody movies. He even surpass Keenen Ivory Wayans "Scary Movies". But the "Scary Movie 4" was not that good, than previous part. It's really entertaining, but I think, it would be better...<br /><br />Anna Faris and Regina Hall acted like always - very entertained. Regina Hall is a true silly black woman and I LIKE HER. All actors do the best of their roles...<br /><br />There was no idea - they take "War of the Worlds", "The Village", "Saw", "Brokeback Mountain", "The Grudge" and more movies parts and make of them a huge spoof. That spoof brainwash a lot of humans brains and make them to buy a ticket to the "Scary Movie 4" show...<br /><br />I can't wait for the 5th part, because it will never bored me...
