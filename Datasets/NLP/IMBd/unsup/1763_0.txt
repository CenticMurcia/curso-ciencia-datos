Firstly I'm a fan of this saga,and played it from the fifth installment,and I'll buy a ps3 just for this saga(and for metal gear solid too)Many people says that FF VIII is the weakest of the series.Why?Is it because it tells a perfect love story?Or is it because it hasn't got a perfect villain like Sephiroth?I love this game so much,cause Squall is a lot like me,and he gives me more courage to open up people after I've finished the game,and after that;life become more beautiful than ever for me.Just this enough for me to say,that's the best game I've ever played,but other characters,their relationships,graphics,astonishing and flawless FMV's(best opening and ending movies for a game by so far),musics("eyes on me"rocks!)and above all it's real emotions that characters felt in the game,OK,other FF's are great too(especially FF7)but this one has a special sense for itself,more humanist and more romantic,between darkness and light,poetic and has a strong view about life and death.So just play it through the end,you'll understand what I mean.bye 10\10
