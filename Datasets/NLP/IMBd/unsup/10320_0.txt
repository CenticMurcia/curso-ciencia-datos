Ozon seems to have made here, what he couldn't quite succeed with See The Sea. Charlotte Rampling's performance is so amazing it hurts. But the real credit should be given to Ozon himself. It's surprising for a director of his age to make a film so economic, so mature and hiding the director from the viewer when it's all depending on the director. It's a master's work. It's Fran√ßois Ozon's masterpiece. a touching drama about a woman's denial of her loss, an everyday habit maybe like mentioned in the "waves". the last shot of Charlotte Rampling running on the sands towards the illusion of her husband is amazing. and how ozon cuts it before she ever reaches.
