"Crime Wave" is a slick little "B" thriller that has been rediscovered recently. Directed by Andre De Toth, it's a neat little "film noire" that has become a classic of sorts. It was filmed in 1952 but not released until 1954 and then came out on the bottom half of a double bill. It runs a scant 73 minutes but contains all of the dark shadows, special lighting and plenty of night scenes common in films of this genre. It was filmed entirely in 1952 Los Angelis except for a few process rear projection "in car" shots.<br /><br />Three criminals, Doc Penny (Ted De Corsia), Ben Hastings (Charles Bronson aka Buchinsky) and Gat Morgan (Nedrick Young) are on a crime wave, robbing gas stations and small businesses. The film opens at a gas station where Gus Snider (Dub Taylor) is the night clerk. Morgan slugs snider but a passing cop suspects trouble and stops. Morgan shoots the cop but gets shot himself. Hastings makes sure of the cop.<br /><br />Penner gives Morgan some money and tells him to go to the apartment of Steve Lacey (Gene Nelson) a former in-mate acquaintance to await Dr. Hessler (Jay Novello), a de-frocked physician who will help him. Lacey and his wife Ellen (Phyllis Kirk) want no part of this for fear that Steve will be drawn back into a life of crime. Just before Dr. Hessler arrives Morgan dies.<br /><br />Meanwhile, back at the scene of the crime, Police Lt. Sims (Sterling Hayden) begins his investigation. He rounds up all of the usual suspects in the hope of learning where the criminals have gone. He narrows it down to Lacey's apartment. He goes to Lacey's apartment and begins to badger Steve and Ellen believing that once a crook always a crook.<br /><br />Later, Penner and Hastings turn up at the apartment and threaten Ellen with harm unless Steve plays along with their plans to rob a bank. They then go to Penner's hideout where Sully (Mack Chandler) and the psycho Johnny Haslett (Timothy Carey) await them. They finalize their plans and plan to leave Ellen behind with Haslett as insurance that Steve will do his part.<br /><br />They go to the bank where Sully cuts the power and.................................................<br /><br />Sterling Hayden is excellent as the seedy determined cop. With his rumpled suit, uneven tie, tooth pick and imposing 6'5" frame, he makes an intimidating figure. Gene Nelson, who was a song and dance man, impresses in a rare dramatic role. Although there's no "femme fatale" to speak of, Phyllis Kirk's Ellen comes a across as a wife in control of her husband.<br /><br />The rest of the cast is made up of established and recognizable character actors. Except for Bronson, most had been around for years and make excellent foils for the leading players. And watch for Iris Adrian and Fritz Feld being questioned at police headquarters and Hank Worden as Lacey's boss.<br /><br />It's great to see Warner Bros. bringing back these lost little classics. This film and nine other films are included in "Film Noire Volume 4" on DVD.
