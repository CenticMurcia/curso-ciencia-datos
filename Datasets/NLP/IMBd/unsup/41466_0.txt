The first scene of this movie is the best scene, and as soon as it's over the movie falls flat on its face and never gets up. Darrell Hammond and Dave Foley are the only things worth watching in this movie, and they are given almost nothing to do. At some point, the producers should have realized what was going on, thrown out the script, and let Hammond and Foley improv their own movie. Whatever they'd have come up with would have been miles better than the nerdfest that this film is.<br /><br />What is the problem? Well, for one thing, this is one of those "vampire" stories where the writers think they have to cleverly re-invent the vampire mythos for the hundredth time. And in this case, their re-invention is not at all clever, and is so contrived that the movie has to be narrated, so they can endlessly explain their idea of how the vampire thing works. It takes a lot away from the flow of the film. You'd like to see the story unfold, but the idiotic protagonist has to keep interrupting with dumb little explanations, of dumb ideas, accompanied by cartoons and dumb 50's music.<br /><br />If you don't like narrated movies, or sci-fi nerd movies, you won't have any patience for this kind of thing.<br /><br />The story is lame and dull. Only Darrell Hammond and Dave Foley are worth watching, even though Foley is tragically underused yet again. Amy Davidson plays a temp who follows movie logic and immediately hits on the nerd protagonist, again a nerd movie trope. In reality, hot young temps don't come on to whatever shlub showed them around on their first day. She also has one of the most embarrassingly stupid scenes in recent movie memory, where she has a little monologue about how much ventriloquists turn her on. I can't respect any actress who wasn't smart enough to turn down a part like this.<br /><br />Steve Burns as the protagonist is just in the way. A Simon Pegg wannabe.
