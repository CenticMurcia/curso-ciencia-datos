This plays like a long situation comedy, except that after the first few minutes any basis in reality, no matter how exaggerated, is lost. Bill Murray, as Bob, suffers from multiple phobias and, after an initial brief interview with psychiatrist Dr. Leo Marvin (Richard Dreyfuss), he becomes so dependent on him that he pursues him to where the Marvin family is away on vacation. To set up the premise of the movie Murray plays Bob initially as mentally disturbed, but his personality quickly changes into that of an irritating, socially inept child. Bob ingratiates himself with Marvin's family while in the meantime driving Marvin nuts. Unfortunately I came to view Bob pretty much as Dr. Marvin did - his behavior was totally inappropriate and I wished he would just go away. It is beyond me why Marvin's family did not also feel this way. <br /><br />In an era when the work of Freud has been greatly discredited this movie seems compelled to propagate the stereotypical image of a psychiatrist as one who worships at the feet of the master, having busts of him in his office and in his vacation home, and even naming his children Sigmund and Anna. <br /><br />Things turn absurdly silly toward the end.<br /><br />Outside of its contrived humor not being particularly funny, the reason I really dislike this film is its portrayal of mental illness for humorous effect. Anyone who has known a phobic person understands the pain and suffering caused by the illness and knows that there is no cure by taking a few "baby steps" over a period of a few days, as implied in this film. The same criticism goes for making fun of Tourette's Disorder.
