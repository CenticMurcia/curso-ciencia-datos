The only reason to watch this show is to watch Dominic Keating being wickedly evil as the arch-demon Mallos. He's only in 6 of the 22 episodes. This was one of Keating's pre-Enterprise sci-fi gigs (which include Buffy, SU2 and GvsE.) The rest of the series seriously sucks. Lamas is wooden. The character Goodwin is annoying. The character Sara is pathetic. This is another show that COULD have been great. Too bad. Now the pilot (Demons of the Night parts one and two) is out on video. Cashing in on Keating's new found fame no doubt. Well, they might as well make as much money as they can on this turkey. Keating's probably the only one who'll have a career until this is gone and forgotten.
