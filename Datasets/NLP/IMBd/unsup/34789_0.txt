Buddy Hackett narrated this crap "once upon a snowflake".... pffft!<br /><br />The greedy people in town are in the dumps because their supply of 'ice-money' is melting and the Russian dictator down the block wants the hottest girl in the village to be his chick... or something like that. Calling Jack Frost to restore a cold weather climate to anywhere on the globe.<br /><br />Totally charmless holiday special with a sour plot which involves coins, taxes, going broke, and the 'flake-flipping snow gypsies'.... huh?<br /><br />Produced by Rankin/Bass, though they've done much better.
