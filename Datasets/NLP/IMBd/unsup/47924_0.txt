Okay - I'm not sure why anybody would seriously call this something that ranks along with Disney, but the only reason you want to watch this is to see how bad it is.<br /><br />I can't understand how the producers managed to get such good high profile voice talent... but I also would be incredibly surprised to see if John Goodman thinks this is truly something he wants anybody to see. It's absolute animated crap.<br /><br />Obviously the producers had money and spent it on hiring a great casting director, who was well connected... and yet all the actors signed on to something that was absolute crap... did they even SEE any of the animation before it was being voiced? <br /><br />Why didn't the producers spend any money on hiring GOOD animators? As it stands, this ranks among the worst of the lowest-level outsourced amateur-level Saturday morning animation in the world.<br /><br />Reading the praise it's received in previous comments is making me crazy. Seriously, all of you need to see more television and film if you can sit there and actually say this is worth seeing. More likely, you hated it too, but in some malicious, disturbed form of sadism you need others to suffer, too.<br /><br />AAAAAAAARGH!<br /><br />I grew up watching children's television and I work in children's television today. I guarantee you, if you're looking for quality holiday film viewing for your family for the holidays, you should buy a copy of the original 1964 TV special.<br /><br />Inflicting this piece of "entertainment" on your family should be considered a mild form of spousal, elder and/or child abuse.<br /><br />As I mentioned, I work in television and I have to watch this movie today as part of my job and I just wanted to share my pain with you.<br /><br />I can't tell the difference between watching this, or stabbing myself in the eye with a fork. At least with the fork, my eye will heal. But the scars inflicted on my psyche watching 'Rudolph: The Movie' will never heal.<br /><br />Never.<br /><br />Please ignore me now as I crawl into a fetal position under my desk and die.
