French movies are used to investigating human thoughts, behaviors. Chabrol makes it perfectly. As you might know, he is a typical french director, sometimes boring but specially relevant and with accurate analysis in this film. The feeling of jealousy and suspicion is perfectly described, Jacques Gamblin as a tortured painter is, as always, amazing and touching. The well known humorist for his Euro Trash show, Antoine De Caunes, is scheming and surprisingly good enough. It's true that Sandrine Bonnaire and Valeria Tedeschi are kind of insipid and correspond to the cold french girl stereotype I hate. Anyway, the film is perfectly directed as a french thriller, which actually helps to know a bit more about the birth of jealousy.
