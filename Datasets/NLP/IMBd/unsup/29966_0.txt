Orphan Eleni was looked after by Alexis' family. As she grown up, she involved in an embarrassing situation. Although she was in love with Alexis, his father tried to separate them. Even his father wanted to marry her. The young pair had nothing to do but escape. However what happened next were not what they expected.<br /><br />One of exciting scenes was that a crowd of people danced in a worn-out place. Although life was hard for them, they still knew how to enjoy themselves. That is good. Optimism is the best medicine for difficult position.<br /><br />I thought it would be a hard-to-know film. After watching it, I found I was wrong. Director Theo Angelopoulos taught me a good lesson about Greek history with elegant way. The lively music should not be overlooked. It is the first one of trilogy. I am looking forward to watching remaining two films though they have not been finished yet.<br /><br />A great Greek drama. 8/10
