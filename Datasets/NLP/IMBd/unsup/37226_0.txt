I'm not one for horror movies, but I am one for a good mystery. From the advertisements, I thought this movie was going to be based on actual events of trying to capture an internationally notorious serial killer. The little bit of being "not-human" grabbed my attention furthermore, due to the idea that there really could be missing links in the evolutionary scale. Instead, I'm handed crap. My friend and I viewed possibly one of the worst movies ever, but unexpectedly hilarious. As well, how dare Hollywood Pictures have the gall to advertise a horror movie when it is a lame excuse of a somewhat political agenda. Yes, there is suffering in this world, but how dare the powers that be exploit such poverty with horrific humour. Sadly enough, I caught myself laughing at Orlando Jones' lines and the badly made CG deaths. If you dare see this B movie (maybe C or D), be sure to not watch the advertisements.
