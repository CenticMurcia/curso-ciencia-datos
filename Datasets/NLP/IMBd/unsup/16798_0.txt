While the United States and Japan duke it out during World War II, doctors Otto Kruger (as Jan), Elissa Landi (as Royce), and Donald Woods (as Michael) must sort out their "love triangle." On the strategically located Philippine island of "Corregidor", the good doctors get to see some of the war action. Stock footage is flown in. Of course, Ms. Landi, being a "lady doctor", is protected from viewing "mutilated" corpses. Right. Although it isn't enough to recommend the film, Rick Vallin (as Pinky Mason) and Wanda McKay (as Hey Dutch) are relatively entertaining.<br /><br />"Dedicated to the United States and Philippine Armed Services"
