I bought this movie on the clearance rack at a local electronics store recently, and it was worth every penny. I saw Sean Penn, Ed Harris, and Gary Oldman on the cover.....how could it not rock?! Well, it does. Gary Oldman is one of my favorite actors and he really steals the show here. You really believe he's the character that he's depicting. Oldman fans must see this film.<br /><br /> POSSIBLE SPOILERS!!!!:<br /><br /> Sean Penn is an undercover cop sent back to his home town to infiltrate the local Irish gangs, who coincidentally enough, happen to be comprised of some old friends...including his best friend Jackie (Oldman). Frankie (Harris), Jackie's older brother, runs the show in the gang, and calls all the shots. It was very satisfying to see Harris play a ruthless bad guy, as it's usually not his cup of tea. Terry (Penn) is torn between his commitment to his job and his feelings for his old buds. The Irish mob is in the middle of negotiations with the Italian mafia to make some more dough as well. Terry comes in and all hell breaks loose.<br /><br /> This movie has excellent acting from Harris, Oldman, and Penn.....but for me Oldman steals the show. He's just crazy. Wild, uninhibited and completely convincing. The score in this movie is quite moving too, and really suits the movie. I feel this movie has gone quite unnoticed and deserves more credit. I can't believe it only has a 7.1 rating. I give it an 8 myself. Smokers beware. Have your cigs handy, because this movie will make you want to smoke a pack!<br /><br /> If you like any of the cast in other movies, I highly recommend State of Grace.
