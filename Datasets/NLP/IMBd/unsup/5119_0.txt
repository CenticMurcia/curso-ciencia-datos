The first segment, the one with Roddy M. and Ossie Davis, was by far the scariest movie, tv show, etc. I have ever seen.<br /><br />The first time I saw it I was 13 years old and it scared the wits out of me! Even 20 years later, during the day with all the lights on-it still has the same effect. I still get goosebumps just thinking about that painting.<br /><br />Rod Serling's Night Gallery is a throwback to the good old days of horror movies when good writing was more important than senseless violence or gore.<br /><br />In other words, this is 'old school' horror that will really strike a chord with the viewer, much like Serling's 'Twilight Zone' episodes.<br /><br />This tv-movie is difficult to purchase and is not aired often so make sure you see it when it comes on.<br /><br />But if you see it at night and alone, don't say I didn't warn you!
