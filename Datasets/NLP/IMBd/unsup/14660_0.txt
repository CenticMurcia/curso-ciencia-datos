I've seen this movie,and i said to my self after about 45 min in to the movie,what is this i'm watching?. It felt like watching discovery channel. The acting was bad and it seems like it was made on a low budget... The acting felt like they wore reading to each other. You can actually see that the sharks clips they are using in this movie actually comes from different documentaries. Well that's all i can say about this movie that it is a waste of time. There are a good movies & bad movies this one is a bad....<br /><br />Well you can listen to the other comment but in the end you will see that i have truly said what kind of movie this is.
