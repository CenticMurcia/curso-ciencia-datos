Actually...I still do. Let me preface this comment by stating that I have seen every episode of the show numerous times and own all the DVDs.<br /><br />But this movie...goddamn, I felt like shooting myself about 20 minutes through, but had to sit through another hour. It felt like a dragged out, terrible episode of the show, with about 10 minutes total of funny things.<br /><br />The only really funny part was the beginning, I thought.<br /><br />In the end, I still love the show. But honestly, this movie was crap, and I'm pretty sure it was just made by Matt and Dave to see how much random crap they could pull and still get your 10 bucks (the most genius part of the film).
