With all the potential this movie had, they allowed this to be the final script for their movie. I honestly would compare this to the likes of Caddyshack II or Jaws: The Revenge. This was the boringest movie I've ever sat through but it's certainly not the worst. I remember liking this movie when I first watched it but when I bought both DVD's of The Ring and Ring 2 I actually fell asleep, and I've never fallen asleep during a movie. I do not recommend this movie for sh*t. It was so bad and I felt like I was losing IQ points during.<br /><br />Overall this movie was a disgrace and the biggest waste of time I've ever bought. 1/10.
