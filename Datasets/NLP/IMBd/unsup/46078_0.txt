One never knows what will be a hit, until it hits. The reason for this Disney Computer Animation's demise is simple: they strayed from the Disney formula. There were enigmatic characters, a compelling story, and great animation. There were awesome visuals, a great story, and some innovative ideas. But ... it was not fun. Actually, it was neither fun, nor funny.<br /><br />Most Disney fans are prepared to learn a moral lesson whenever they sit down with the popcorn and the kiddies to view the latest Disney venture, but they are also prepared to laugh, to have fun, and to enjoy the family time. Unfortunately, Valiant fails to deliver in those three key areas. <br /><br />Honestly, this WWII film didn't even manage to rally patriotism!<br /><br />The visuals are striking and the story is great, but there isn't enough wit in any form to make this a "good" Disney movie. As it is? It's just a Disney movie, and it's nothing special.<br /><br />It rates a 4.4/10 from...<br /><br />the Fiend :.
