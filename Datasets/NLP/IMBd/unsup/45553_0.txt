I got this movie out of the bargain bin for a laugh, and honestly a laugh is all you can get out of this.<br /><br />The plot in a nutshell: American family re-locate to Ireland, man gets fusty over a hairy mutt and with the added extra of cheap Sinclair Spectrum style morphing the dog changes into a woman, he gets bedazzled by her baps and ignores his family to go off for a romp with her. All is well (unless by this point the cheesy porn music doesn't make you want to pull your ears off)until this hairy geezer shows up, with may I say equally bad acting, he wants to romp with the American's wife, but she is having none of it, in the end you get to see more Spectrum special effects, a woman changing into a robotic style bird with horrendous flapping wings and more crap music. There are more bad mistakes in this film that makes it more funny than making you want to get anything aroused by the woman's gyrating and boobs fwapping all over the place.<br /><br />For instance, she is supposed to be Irish and not have any luxuaries, yet when she does take her clothes off and actually speaks you can see she has very distinct tan lines and she has a strong American accent.<br /><br />All in all this film was fun for a laugh and making this review, I recycled the box for another DVD and the disc itself has ended up a rather artistic drinks coaster.
