Gorgeous movie. My only real problem is the screen at the end claiming that the Indians got wiped out after they converted. They did, ... but there was also this little thing called the French and Indian War.<br /><br />And in that war, these Indians happened to side with the French. <br /><br />The F&I War was pretty dang big, cost enough money to cause the American Revolution a few years later, and ended in a gargantuan battle where the British won because the kill ratio was 3 dead French/allies for every 2 British/allies.<br /><br />So yeah, the movie's a little disingenuous there.<br /><br />Also, what's with this stupid 10-line minimum?
