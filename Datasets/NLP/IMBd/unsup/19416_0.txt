I'm a huge Steve McQueen fan and have seen as much of him as I could from The Blob through The Hunter. In his later movies, the characters he plays are complex and real--so much so, that there's a blur between the character and the actor.<br /><br />This movie isn't an Oscar-winner, but as a nuanced character, McQueen is doing some of his finest work here. There are one or two awkward plot elements--the friend who commits suicide, for example. But the acting is superb, the pacing nice.<br /><br />This and Tom Horn were beautiful final testaments to a man who made acting a little more realistic, a little less wooden, than was common in his day. I rank this movie high for the sheer fun of it. You don't see chase scenes between a Trans Am and a harvester every day.
