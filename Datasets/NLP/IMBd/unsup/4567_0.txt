What did I just watch?.....<br /><br />I have no idea what I just just endured but it was not the Neverending Story. That was.... I'm not sure i can put into words but here goes nothing...<br /><br />The acting was absolutely terrible... like something from a junior high theatre production. The movie seemed to drag on for days on end. This may possibly be the worst movie EVER created. This movie, if you can call it that, made me want to die.<br /><br />PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE! Save yourself from the utter brain cell annihilation that is this movie.
