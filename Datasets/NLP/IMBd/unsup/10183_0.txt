I saw this film for the first time over a week ago and can't get it out of my mind. I was not familiar with the story nor had I ever seen Robert Duvall in such an powerful but understated performance. At first I wondered if I would like the movie but soon found I could not take my eyes off the screen. It was like being transported back in time to a place I've never been, and was watching this story unfold as if it was actually happening right in front of me. Robert Duvall was amazing, absolutely stunning. The story says so much about love and how important it is for all of us. Watch this movie...it is riveting and such a great story!
