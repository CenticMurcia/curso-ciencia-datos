I might be exceptionally stupid, but I didn't understand this movie at all! The plot had something to do with serial killers, cloning and genetic engineering, but the main thing might have been something else. I don't know, since I couldn't follow for longer than the first couple of minutes. <br /><br />The characters weren't properly introduced and there were too many of them (plus their clothes and hairs looked ridiculous). Most of the characters seemed out of place. They were quirky, but no reason was given for their quirkiness. Sooner or later they died, so one didn't have to wonder about them anymore. The main characters were the dullest characters in the movie, which was very annoying. They too were apparently genetically modified, but that seemed to be a completely irrelevant subplot (though I probably missed something important concerning that...)<br /><br />My advice, don't watch the movie!
