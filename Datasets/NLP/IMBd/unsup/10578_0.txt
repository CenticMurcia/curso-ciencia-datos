When I saw this film, i couldn't believe what I saw, whoever backed this film with money and finance needs shooting, its just awful, utter dire. The ex hobbit's acting is like something out of an Australian sitcom you see at 2pm in the afternoon!, He must have been desperate to shed his "Mr. Frodo" Role to take this. Vinny Jones??? Well after the performance he put in this, he doesn't deserve to act ever again, the over use of the obviously "Tring too hard" cockney accent was an embarrassment to watch, as was the bit where each bank robber says his "I'm hard" sentence. The girl who played the FBI agent's acting was a laugh, when she walled up the hobbit after her partner was shot, that was hilarious. seriously though there should be a agency or watchdog kind of thing, that prevents movies as bad as this being allowed to be sold / distributed to the public. I don't care what Market or territory this film is aimed at it's so bad it's a rip off to rent it on DVD or see it at the cinema.
