From start-to-finish, this movie is a stinker. Bad acting, lousy script and terrible production values. I can see Joe Namath doing it but it's hard to believe that an accomplished actress like Ann-Margaret agreed to appear in this loser. That being said, I just located and purchased this hard-to-find flick at the aptly-named Cheesy Movies.com. Why? Because it is the only movie that blue-eyed soul man Wayne Cochran and the C.C. Riders ever appeared in. If there are any Cochran fans reading this, grab this movie and catch Wayne and his boys doing a full-length version of "I Can't Turn You Loose". Wayne Cochran recordings are very hard to come by, let alone a cinematic appearance. It was worth the $4.98 I paid for it.
