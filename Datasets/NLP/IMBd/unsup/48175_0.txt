Contains spoilers, for those who _do_ care<br /><br />Well, I watched it, the whole thing, and I didn't like it one bit. You might have guessed that I don't believe in God, and if you do you might like it. But for me it was just plain boring, I was waiting all the while for something to happen, but nothing happened. It was all a bunch of praise and preach to me, and I don't watch praise and preach for fun.<br /><br />Furthermore, the humour used in this movie is the worst ever, there were _several_ humourously intended phrases, which have been known to mankind ever since the internet was invented, can you believe they actually said things like "I'm not a vegetarian because I love animals, I'm a vegetarian because I hate plants." that is sooooo old, and this wasn't the only one too. <br /><br />I can imagine some people liking the ending, in which a bunch of believers miraculously keep singing praise while they should be burning (and in my opinion they should be, regarding the performance they delivered). Also, the main character (an agnost), is heavily stereotyped as the seeing is believing kinda guy who needs proof of God. Well personally I've been in enough discussions about this to know that demanding proof of God is rather useless. <br /><br />Ah well, if you believe, you might like it, if not, you might not. I hated it and I rate it at 2/10.
