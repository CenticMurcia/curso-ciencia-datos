IT WAITS is a horribly disappointing creature movie about a young female forest ranger, still grieving over the accidental death of her friend, due to a car crash. While on-duty and at her post, she is visited by her boyfriend who tries to help her get past her guilt. One night they are awoken by something on the roof. When they investigate the noise, they find that their satellite has been ripped apart and their jeep rolled over. It turns out that they are up against a mythological, bloodthirsty demon that was released by a group of unsuspecting cave explorers who were torn apart by it. The movie has a nice look as well as a cool looking creature, sort of looking like the Creeper from Jeepers Creepers combined with Pumpkinhead, but it still seemed to be lacking in suspense and action. Very forgettable film...
