Yeah when I first saw the commercials for this movie I was like. Oh God this movie will be boring. I was right. It starts out with four college students. (All who look like they are in there late 20's) driving down the road obviously fast forwarded listening to awful music. They break into a park and run over a baby bear. Soon they are followed by its mother. Every time she kills someone animated blots of blood splatter. And I don't even want to comment on the car which over heats, flips, and amazingly enough still runs.<br /><br />The acting was so bad I rooted for the bear the entire time. I can't even believe that they made and aired this junk.<br /><br />Rating 1 out of 10
