It's about as campy as high school theater with an ending as satisfying as a sharp stick in the eye.<br /><br />The movie itself is a farce. It borders on utterly ridiculous at times even by the standard of farces. There are enjoyable story arcs and a bit of workable humor, but the few redeeming elements (namely the love arc) of the movie are completely crushed by a rushed and largely unresolved ending. It's the most unsatisfying satisfying ending to a movie I'll ever seen.<br /><br />I won't pretend that there's no entertainment value to the movie, but it can't be taken seriously on any level and it ultimately ends up being an overall let down.<br /><br />If you like fantastical Broadway-type entertainment with no value placed on story, then you will probably like this movie. Otherwise, skip it.
