Wow - so many comments for a foreign film! This film is not for everyone - like most foreign films - and by it's title, you can assume that there's a good chance that there's quite a bit of sexual content in it, so I'm not sure why anyone would criticize it for that.<br /><br />Anyway, this is by far one of the better films I've seen recently, and it's not really about sex, but about the relationship Lucia has with her boyfriend and the crisis he is going through. The story line is totally unpredictable, which is the beauty of it. If you liked Kieslowski's trilogy (Blue - white - red), you should like this film. Highly recommended.
