The movie portrayed to me, young love in it's purest form, lived unconditionally and with great courage. Too often people fail to love with such courage. They clutch at their hearts along with their pocket books and head for the door. I found myself feeling immense pride for this young man in his endeavor. We all know that too often in life things don't have a storybook ending but this one did and I enjoyed it. I loved the characters, the music, the settings and the humor injected. I would like to see more from these young people.
