I used to be a big fan of this show as a teen growing up, but as an adult I find the antics of Will Smith's characters annoying and repugnant. In each episode, Smith acts like a jerk to someone or does something that will obviously negatively effect some other character. Then he continues to act like a jerk while attempting to cover up whatever misdeeds he previously took part in. All of this for the final five minutes where Smith has an epiphany and then is absolved of his actions.<br /><br />Will Smith's character consists loud and goofy noises and constantly cracking jokes about his looks. His character is extremely narcissistic and classless. The only redeeming quality of this show is Uncle Phil who is actually a decent actor with good comedic timing. Too bad this show degrades his weight every week while going after the lowest common denominator
