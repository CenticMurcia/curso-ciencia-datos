This documentary should never have been released,it is sick,vile,horrific,shocking and disturbing.The film should have been banned in the UK as it shows real-life images of people being shot by firing squads,it shows a man executed in the electric chair and shows a man have his jaw blown off by a gun.I can't understand why this was released or even made, who would want to watch real-life footage of people dying in such horrific ways?This film is a very disturbing documentary and should never have been released to the public.
