This is another one of those rambling, pointless mid-1980's comedies that keep going on and on, without having anything to say, and without caring if the viewer is still amused or interested. The teaming of Matthau and Williams may appear promising, but it doesn't pay off, and the film is scarcely funny. Halfway through, the thin script has run completely out of steam, and there is nothing for the viewer to expect...apart from the redeeming "THE END", of course.
