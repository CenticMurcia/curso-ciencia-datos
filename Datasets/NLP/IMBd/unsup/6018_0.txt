Fred MacMurray, Melvyn Douglas, and Jean Arthur star in this very loose adaptation of the W. Somerset Maugham play about a woman with a dilemma that could potentially be scandalous. Jean Arthur's husband (MacMurray) supposedly drowns and is legally declared dead. Arthur marries his best friend (Douglas). MacMurray then turns up alive a year later. That's the simple premise behind this little seen film from 1940. Jean Arthur's voice, smile, and comic timing were always impeccable, and this film is no exception. While MacMurray and Douglas seem awkward in spots, eventually they gel enough to hold this farce together. Consistently funny throughout with great dialog and comic situations, comparisons have been drawn between it and My Favorite Wife which was actually released later that year. Harry Davenport shines as Arthur's fussy live-in father. Melville Cooper is the dour butler. Edgar Buchanan and Tom Dugan are great in their brief bit near the end. This is one of those films where casting makes all the difference. These pros sell it to us lock, stock, and barrel. I doubt this film could be cast today. *** of 4 stars.
