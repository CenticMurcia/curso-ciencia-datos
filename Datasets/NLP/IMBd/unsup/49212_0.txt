This is a film that may captivate those interested in Catholic theology - others should stay away. There is too much chat, as a futuristic (set in 1999) priest visits a monastery in Ireland that refuses to give up the Latin mass. Not very exciting stuff.<br /><br />But there is a marvellous performance from Trevor Howard, an almost as good one from Cyril Cusack, and it's nice to see young Martin Sheen and Michael Gambon. Scenery and cinematography are also nice.
