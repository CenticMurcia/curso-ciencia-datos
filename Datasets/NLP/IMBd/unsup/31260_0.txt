'?' : Is a raunchy, daring, slap your face off take on America today. It appears to have been made by super-intelligent pre-pubescent boys, and I mean that as a compliment.<br /><br />Everyone in the American societal web seems to be lampooned and held up to ridicule, some definitely more than others. <br /><br />The entwined undertones of the movie kept me from fully enjoying it during the first pass through, because of having to think a bit too much to decipher the true nature and purpose of the lead actors' (West + Art) dialogue and conduct. Thus I watched it 2 Â½ more times, which finally brought me full comic release. I don't know if I am just dumb, miss the American-specific subtleties, or if the Director/Writers intended to make the film a thinkers-man comedy, deep and dark? I would like to say the later, but you can judge for yourselves. Viewers would be well advised to leave any sensitivity at home, you won't need it. The masturbation/rape scene is pure brilliance (never knew a "fork" could have so many uses??) and the church diatribe is one I will never forget. Memorable scenes abound throughout '?', but be prepared to think, awe and feel guilty for laughing. <br /><br />Overall, a very so-wrong, yet it's so-right way to spend a few hours.
