This show , "Freaks & Geeks" , is so good and it's just like real life. This show is realistic in some ways and it always has a funny side to it. I think "Freaks & Geeks" is funny and that's the reason why I watch this. I wish it was never cancelled and I wish there were more episodes. They should keep making more episodes because it is very kool. I think everyone should be watching this great TV programme. This is one of the best programmes I've ever seen.
