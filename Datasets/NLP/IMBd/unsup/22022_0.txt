OK, I'm not a member of the target demographic for this movie. I can't say for sure what the target is, but no one makes movies for those of us over 35. So I can assume I wasn't the audience the film makers were trying to reach.<br /><br />But it did reach me, I loved it, and I highly recommend it. The world created in the film is familiar to us all. In less capable hands, that world could have been flat and lifeless on screen. Not so here. The every day life of friends is shown as raucous, witty, poignant, and as painful as we know real life to be.<br /><br />The cast embraced the characters, obviously having a good time bringing them to life. You like these people and root for them until the end of the film. Clea DuVall has the pivotal scene in the movie, and is flawless as she takes you through Jen's search for love despite her insecurity. Jensen Ackles' performance makes sure you'll never look at tampon commercials the same way ever again. And special kudos to Alice Krige, who doesn't have a lot of screen time, but her Zo is memorable.<br /><br />I've read some criticisms about the sex in the film; it's definitely in-your-face stark, but I don't think it was out of line for the storyline of the characters involved.<br /><br />The soundtrack was dead-on, complimenting the timing of the story with just the right mood and expanding the aura of the characters as they cruise through the film.<br /><br />Bottom line - I laughed, I cried. Then I laughed again, while I was crying. Any film that can take me through that in 98 minutes gets my over-35 vote of confidence.
