This movie blew chunks. All of these so called actors in this film need to never ever work in the film industry again. The plot was pointless and the acting especially from Trina wasn't on point. Who comes up with a plan on banning their men from having sex with them just so that they can keep their neighborhood drug free? I'll admit that some of the characters like Sommore & Mother Africa were some of the few high points in this terrible film. The only good thing about the film was that many of the females in the film were looking good but unfortunately cannot act if their life depended on it. Hopefully, films like this will not continue to see the day of light. Also this would discourage rappers to think that they can carry a movie without paying their dues (50 Cent, Ja Rule, DMX, Trina, Drag On etc.).
