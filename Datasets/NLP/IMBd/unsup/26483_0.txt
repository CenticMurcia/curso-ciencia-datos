This was a good movie from what I saw even if some of the drama was cheesy. The suspense was good and I liked the characters. I think its a movie worth watching if you feel like movie that has conflict, suspense, and drama. The fact that the son wanted to spend more time with his dad was good. Also the son being bitten added suspense and brought the father and son closer together. I do think some of the problems were a bit cheesy and too classic (the woman being pregnant and happening to have her baby on that occasion)Overall though it was good. I think it is more suitable for a person who likes movies that have classic morals and simple plots.
