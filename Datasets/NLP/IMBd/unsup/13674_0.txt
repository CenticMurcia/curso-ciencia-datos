This movie was given an 8/10 purely because of Meryl Streep's forever amazing performance. This movie is truly haunting. "...There are still some things we have yet to imagine", is the slogan of this movie. This is true because some of the things in the world are just too difficult to imagine. Sophie's Choice dares to show us those true horrors of life. Kevin Kline was also incredible with his portrayal of someone with a schizophrenic disorder before the time when that sort of thing was recognized. Peter MacNicol had an easy, but still memorable performance. This movie has a place in history, due to it's disturbing and unimaginably painful decisions and ideals it drives our minds to, and Meryl Streep has raised the bar in way that almost no one could ever surpass.
