Where'd this film come from and how come it took me til now to see it??? It's a comic masterpiece, hard laughs from start to finish, a wry satire of the tough guy genre. Great cast, especially Liam Neeson who shows a remarkable comic flair. Kudos for that, no doubt, belong to the director (who also wrote it), who assembled a remarkably colorful group of actors and fashioned one of the funniest ensemble performances I've ever seen on the screen, a comedy that unfolds with a paradoxically poetic visual style that keeps you howling even when the actors aren't speaking. Does for James Bond what Strangelove did for the Doomsday Thriller. My advice, if you're the sort who appreciates intelligent satire and understands that pop culture garbage like "How I Met Your Mother" isn't at all funny; get a copy asap, make some popcorn, take the phone off the hook and put aside enough time to watch it twice (you will). One last question; where's the darn sequel???
