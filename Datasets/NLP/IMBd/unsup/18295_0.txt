I just happen to own the VHS version of this film - and I purchased it during the same time I purchased "Spetters". Again, my introduction to foreign films came from the Los Angeles Based "Z" Channel - even with the hundreds of premium channels out there in 2005, I still miss Z for I haven't seen in on American TV since! Quite sad, actually.<br /><br />The well-older guy falling in love with his 14 year old step-daughter theme began as a very disturbing theme to me. So...why did I view this film? As with 'Pandora' (yes, the Greek myth), I just had to know and the "Z" channel provided the choice. In watching, the film didn't go where I thought it would. It was funny. This film does take into account many sensibilities, and the unveiling of feelings that are quite into the "You can't help who you fall in love with" bit. Who's cruising whom - is the ultimate question and it may not be as clear cut as you may think.<br /><br />This is a well made, adult oriented themed foreign film somewhat on the Lolita theme. Hits everything, makes you wonder and provides a story...maybe not one for everyone, but one that has many sides and you be the judge.
