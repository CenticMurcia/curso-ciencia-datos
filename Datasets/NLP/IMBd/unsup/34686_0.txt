It's not the most terrible show ever, it's just not very good and one of those American sitcoms you're likely to forget in years to come. If you're bored, it might be worth watching but try and find something else first.<br /><br />The characters are annoying, it's hard to care about any of them as they're all so over the top and shouting all the time. Claude is too nice in an annoying way and why do the people with better jobs have to be the ones who are full of themselves? I actually prefer the horrible ones because occasionally they do actually make you laugh unlike Claude and her pals, complete misfits who's characters have been done before (the white geeky guy and the black strong mama type) it's all very safe, unoriginal and boring.<br /><br />Most of the episodes are about the same thing, the bitchy ones are horrible to the nice ones, the nice ones retaliate and they all learn a lesson..all without getting any work done. There are a few OK episodes and i tried to give this show a chance but there's so many other better things to watch out there, this is just an average sitcom with no x factor.
