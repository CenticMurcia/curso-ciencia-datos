Hello. I have seen this movie. It was one of the better movies created about Tomie, the girl who'll never die... because she is bakemono.... Tomie, a girl who is picked on, is at a jewelry store looking, but has no money. Horrible Tomie comes in and steals it and they leave. They exchange names, and the Tomie who had no money is like IN LOVE with Horrible Tomie. That is pretty much the movie. Then you have these 3 dumb girls who want to kill Innocent Tomie but just be rude to her instead because they like having somebody to pick on. Anyway, it is a great movie and better than the other 2 that i've seen. GO SEE IT BECAUSE IT IS GREAT!
