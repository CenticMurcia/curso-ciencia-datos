I watched this movie yesterday with a friend, I have to confess that I would have never made it through the whole thing, if it wasn't for my friend. This film is sooo clich√© and so predictable, I could even speak some dialogues in advance, its the same for the jokes,they are so lame...I couldn't connect to the characters and feel sad or touched....all together this movie just got on my nerves...even if it got a bit better in the end..<br /><br />There really are some good German movies...but this one is definitely not one of them...so take your dog for a walk or your girlfriend out for dinner...everything is better than watching this movie
