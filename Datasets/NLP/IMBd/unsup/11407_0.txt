Clint Eastwood plays the typical tough cop this time around in New Orleans but has secrets. What starts as an interesting crime case and a question of Clint's character drags into an overlong boring venture as the same thing that happens at the beginning continues after 90 of the 115 minutes. TIGHTROPE may add a new dimension to the typical Clint Eastwood character, but it is anything but beneficial.<br /><br />A girl from the red light district is murdered. As night cop and detective, but supporting single father of two, Wes Block is on the case, but his weaknesses may also tie into the murder as the bodies are starting to pile up.<br /><br />Exploring the dark side of human nature is a natural thing in Hollywood. A cop on the edge as much as Block is is a basic and easy way to convey the message. Very little to no artistic quality or direction in TIGHTROPE. The dark settings and scenery are reminiscent stuff of the early 80s (THE TERMINATOR, BLADE RUNNER). If TIGHTROPE was far more straight to the point instead of a terrible bore, it might be a bit more watchable than it is.
