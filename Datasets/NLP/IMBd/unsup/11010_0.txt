I loved this movie when I caught it late night on a cable channel and am not sorry I stayed up most of the night watching this saga of two boys in love (or, at least one of them played by Ben Silverstone). Few movies have the power to move you, and this one did me.<br /><br />I felt Steven's pain as he pined for the Brad Gorton character, John, especially after the two hooked up. John was the macho and popular jock, and had to keep up appearances, even if it meant humiliating Steven publicly with his friends.<br /><br />The scene that meant the most to me and that resonated the most with me was the scene in the gym where Steven was dancing with his best girlfriend and John was with his "girlfriend". The two barely took their eyes off each other. I, myself, have experienced such a moment. Not quite the same as that where I wasn't dancing with anyone at the time, but the girl I loved and still love was, and we maintained eye contact despite her dancing with someone else. That scene ripped at my heartstrings.<br /><br />I don't know if John was in love with Steven. Possibly. But Steven was in love with John. Steven came out at the end in a most dramatic way at a school assembly when he accepted an award with John looking on, but John never came out at all. John, in my estimation, was bisexual or bi-curious and not a confirmed homosexual like Steven. Maybe I am wrong about that. We don't know. It seems that the two of them did not get back together by the end, and we as the audience were left hanging and left to guess what happened after the dramatic school assembly coming out.<br /><br />The movie is funny, charming, somewhat kitschy, and poignant. I recommend it to any young person, straight or gay, and any "old" person who wants to re-live the pangs of youth and unrequited (or requited... if temporarily as here) first love.
