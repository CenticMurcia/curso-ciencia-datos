...make sure you don't kill any bear cubs. That's right. Grizzly Rage is the tale of a group of teenagers who embark upon one of those supremely misguided road-trips, and, for whatever reason, decide to trespass into a wooded quarry, and cheese off a local grizzly bear. What follows is the loosest collection of cobbled-together events I've seen attempting to pass as a film.<br /><br />What little plot exists is just awfully paced. Within the first quarter of an hour, they get lost, attacked, and one of the happy-go-lucky teens dies. Which really leaves me wondering what the other seventy-five minutes of my life is going to spent watching. After that, we're presented with various pointless scenes of the actors pushing their car up a hill, or walking around in the same damn empty hut for at least ten minutes, all without dialogue. These people also sustain some incredible injuries, such as falling on a bear trap, which are quickly ignored when things need to move on. This also allows a character to run a considerable distance on what appears to be a broken leg.<br /><br />The main star, the bear, is obviously appearing either from stock-footage, or a stage-hand wearing bear gloves. Watch out for the point where the guy is literally dragged by his feet back to be attacked some more. I can't go on anymore, this film is just so bad. It is redeemed by the fact that you may find some solace in ripping your teeth into the many, many flaws you will no doubt find. But even then, I predict even that fun would be drained by the terrible ending. Literally, they all die, and then the credits roll.
