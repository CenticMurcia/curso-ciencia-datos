But then again, I completely HATED the first one.<br /><br />The children of Gatlin, who killed their parents back in CotC1, are rounded up and bused to the neighboring town. No investigation, trial, psychiatric evaluations - just taken in by idiots. Along comes reporter Terence Knox, who's having a terrible road trip with it estranged son. They decide to stay in town so dad can get the story and son can act like a whiny punk. Soon enough, the freaky Gatlin kids start getting' religious again and kill a few adults. No one seems to notice they all stand in a pack and brood next to the person who ends up dead. Most of the idiot town gets burned alive at a town meeting but not before some toxic corn subplot is introduced. The movie ends with a good old-fashioned showdown.<br /><br />In spite of a few decent gore scenes, the grossest scene in the movie is a Terence Knox sex scene that may hold the record for fake sweat in a mainstream movie. Actually, I'm still not sure if this was supposed to be a comedy or not.
