this is one very well done film.i wouldn't say it is a comedy,but it certainly is a romance/drama.either way.it's very well written,with snappy dialogue,and great acting by all concerned.there are some real acting heavyweights of the time here.Clark Gable is the headliner,and it's no wonder he was a star.the guy oozes screen presence and charisma even on the small scree.Jean Harlow,called the the ultimate and first true sex symbol sex symbol by some(but also a very talented actress)lends great supporting talent.Myrna Loy(Nora Charles from the Thin Man series of movies,co starring William Powell)is also excellent.James Stewart shows glimmers of his greatness,in a fairly small role,only his fourth credited feature film appearance.there are so many other great supporting players in the cast too numerous to mention.when you have talent like this together,it's hard to have bad film.for me,Wife vs Secretary is a strong 8/10
