This was an early film in the career of Tom Hanks, one of his first successful movies. He would go on to be somewhat hit and somewhat miss throughout the 1980's and become more of a guaranteed hit maker in the 1990's and 2000's. Here he stars alongside a very attractive Daryl Hannah in a nice little romantic comedy that at one point gets rather risqu√© for a PG rated movie during a certain emerging at the Statue of Liberty scene. The film also features SCTV alum John Candy and Eugene Levy both of whom are hilarious in this one. Candy as Hanks' slightly sex obsessed brother and Levy as a researcher who is a bit of a jerk. The story involves Hanks' character who has an accident as a child and falls into the ocean only to encounter a little girl mermaid. Flash years later and he is all grown up and he ends up having an accident at sea and ends up unconscious underwater only to be rescued by a very beautiful lady who later turns up in New York and the two of them hit it off swimmingly. Well of course the lady is the little girl mermaid and Levy's character who also encountered is determined to expose her for the half woman and half fish that she is. Nice movie with good comedy, I loved the moron twins and the secretary who got some lightening to the head. Some of the story seems a bit out there though and at times the movie gets a bit to sappy and the ending kind of did not make any sense. Overall though I thought it was rather good. They would later make a sequel that was a made for television sequel, but I have no urge to see that one.
