I found STRIP SEARCH a thought-provoking and well done piece by some very talented and courageous artists. An example of how TV/Film can be used as a tool to get us to think and look at our world, our times and ourselves. --- BRAVO! and thank you to all involved in this project.<br /><br />The cast, the direction, the script, the crossover dialogue between the two interrogation all worked for me. And the choice of using nudity? How could they have done it otherwise? It really hit home the humiliation and terror of such practices. A somewhat prophetic piece in light of recent events and the exposure of America's tactics in Iraq.<br /><br />I highly recommend that people not only see it, but talk about it. Simply put ... excellent.<br /><br />One question -- Has Lumet EVER made a bad film? I certainly can't think of one. If he has, I haven't seen it.
