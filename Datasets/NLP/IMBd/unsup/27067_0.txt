OK I'm awarding this a 4..... And that is purely because 2 scenes in the entire film were well done, turned up the gore and feeling of real gut wrenching revulsion and just about saved the film from a Zero. <br /><br />So, the plot goes something like this. <br /><br />Teen kids, Murderer systematically butchers them in interesting ways, police detectives follow the trail to its conclusion....<br /><br />with me so far?<br /><br />OK so the plot is flimsy but many horror films have fared on less and done an admirable job of telling a bad story well through good acting and well directed horror scenes. The acting in this is SHOCKING! The "beautiful detective" is just horrible, the drunken retired cop (oh dear god....... another one) is bearable at best, and you are begging for most of the kids to be slaughtered just to end the pain of having to watch them. <br /><br />Kinda harsh seeing as I love trashy B rate horrors, but this really scrapes the bucket...... watch at your peril!<br /><br />the tag line is "Answering the door will never be the same again!" and they are right. I will have to think of this film any time someone knocks!
