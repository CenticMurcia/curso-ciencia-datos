The film has a very simple basic premise. Television has been reduced to the lowest common denominator and people swallow it because they have gotten used to it. As such, they are reduced to an antisocial drone-like resistance that no longer resembles life as our fathers remember. Improve what's on the TV and you'll improve society.<br /><br />For someone who's himself quite sick of all those reality soaps and the garbage that comes out from the Hollywood assembly line, I found this film refreshing and inspirational. Although I wasn't quite fond of the obvious ultra-left ideology you can find in between the lines, the message of this film goes beyond ideology and is a call to all of us.<br /><br />"Democratic" capitalist society has become a tyrannical system run by corporations who enslave us for profit, while we, the average consumer, are barely aware of the golden cage in which we live. We've all become paranoid little f***'s who waste our time on shallow small talk and brainless entertainment rather than having real conversations on real topics and devouring real culture. This film tries to open your eyes to that reality and reach the inner child in all of us.... the inner child that makes us human.<br /><br />Obviously this film doesn't have the budget of a Hollywood blockbuster and the story is most definitely naive, but the very optimism of this film and its lonely dissident cry make it far more interesting to me than anything Hollywood has produced since "V For Vendetta".<br /><br />That's all I have to say......
