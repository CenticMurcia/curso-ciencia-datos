Much underrated comedy masterpiece, profoundly relevant, compassionate and witty. One of the greatest American comedies, a true work of pop art. Unique and unmatched. All performances are great, particularly Michael Greer and the late Kevin Coughlin (1945-76). Director Bruce Kessler's deserves a lot of credit. Cinematography is very fine, as is the music. This great film is STILL ahead of its time, misunderstood by both straights and some gays. The Gay Deceivers should be required viewing at colleges. No other film raises so many important social issues and does it with such grace, simplicity and charm. Although the film was very successful at the time, it has been totally forgotten, and can be found at a handful of video stores ("Video West") in West and North Hollywood. It is particularly puzzling, that Kevin Coughlin's movie career should have ended after this, his most successful film. His obituary states that he worked in European cinema in the seventies, but I have been unable to unearth any information about it.
