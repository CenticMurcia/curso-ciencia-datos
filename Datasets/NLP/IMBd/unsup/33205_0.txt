I noticed a box at my videostore that looked interesting and professionally done, titled Dark Fields. It was nothing but the opposite of that. I rented it, with hopes of a good movie. This film was so awful, I was laughing at some parts. It would not even make a good college film project because the acting is so horrible. To me it was a homage of films like The Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake. I'm not going to say any spoilers, because there are none to say. The plot is very basic, and the characters are ignorant and weak. Thats as close to a spoiler as I can get. My final judgment is... Don't waste your money for this! Rent a classical film like the original 1974 version of The Texas Chain Saw Massacre or if you don't prefer that, the original version of The Exorcist may be for you.
