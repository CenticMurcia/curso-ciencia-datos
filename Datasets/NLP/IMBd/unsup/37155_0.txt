Raptor Island was possibly the worst movie i have ever seen. Characters suck and so do the actors who play them. The visual effects look like animated cartoons. the story is terrible and ending is stupid. All the commandos suck at aiming. And the black guys dies, which pisses me off. I would watch it for a good laugh.<br /><br />It stinks.<br /><br />The ending stinks <br /><br />the actors stink<br /><br />i would rather eat my own vomit then watch this movie again.<br /><br />Only watch this if you wanna laugh
