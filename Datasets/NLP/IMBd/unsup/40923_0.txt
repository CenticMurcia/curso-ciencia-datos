Unless you are interested in twenty-somethings spouting nonsense which they consider profound, you will probably be bored after 10 minutes. While I'm sure the characters can all be found in real life, this movie could only hold someone's interest if the monologues were either hilarious or truly profound. Neither condition is met unfortunately. Actually, I found the film pretty depressing. The characters are all caught in their own Ground Hog scenarios with no wish to break free. The monologues really don't present any new ideas but rehash various conspiracy theories and so forth. If anything, the film demonstrates the need to move out of college towns and get on with your life. 3 out of 10 is generous.
