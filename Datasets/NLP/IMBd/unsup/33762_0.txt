Like Millions of others I loved the original Babe. What a shock when my wife and I ventured out for the new Babe Goes To The City.<br /><br />The sight of Mr. Hoggett getting beat to a pulp in the opening scenes as he was trying to repair his well was nothing to seeing a dog drowning.<br /><br />Thinking back I questioned how anyone could 'do' a poor Babe sequel. All they had to do was follow the original format and collect the accolades but alas... Hollywood strikes again.
