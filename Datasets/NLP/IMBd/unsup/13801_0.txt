A misguided film adaptation of the 1973 Broadway smash, and indirectly a remake of Ingmar Bergman's Smiles of a Summer Night. What should have been a small, character-driven musical gets swallowed up in elaborate sets and costumes, and sadly much of Stephen Sondheim's score was cut. The stage play and Bergman film were set in Sweden; for tax purposes the movie was filmed in Vienna, thus losing Sweden's "perpetual sunset" which served as the story's sexual metaphor. Harold Prince expertly directed the stage version, but he's simply all wrong here; Stanley Donen or Herbert Ross would have been better behind the camera.<br /><br />In 1990 PBS telecast the New York City Opera's production of Night Music (starring Sally Ann Howes and George Lee Andrews) as part of its "Live from Lincoln Center" series. That production captured this musical's wit, sensuality and lyricism. A pity it's not available on DVD.
