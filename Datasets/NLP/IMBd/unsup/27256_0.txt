this is a gem in my movie collection. everyone who watches it falls in love. do yourself a favor, resist the urge and watch "i've been twelve forever" (included on the discs) instead of watching the videos separately. he explains the inspiration/context (but not too much to spoil the presentations) behind each work and then you are able to watch each video. in the end, you will have watched an entirely engaging film about a very humble, gentle, and talented, young boy living inside a man. he is a real genius, and i think there would be many more like him if we took life less seriously and stopped making sense.<br /><br />10 out of 10 because it could not be better!
