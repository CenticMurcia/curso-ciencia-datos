Damian Lewis treats us to a very believable character suffering from schizophrenia, completely obsessed over trying to locate and possibly "reverse" the abduction of his daughter - an event that we are not so sure ever really occurred. Shedding itself of any accompanying score or conventional direction, Keane tightly and uncomfortably focuses on the title character's obsession for the first and last sections of the film. We are convinced he's never incredibly dangerous (save for one or two moments), and watching him fall into a surrogate father role with Kira offers a period where he seems to take on an appearance of a responsible father, as if he were "remembering" what it was like prior to his daughter's alleged abduction.<br /><br />Amy Ryan's willingness to let Keane spend time alone with Kira was a little contrived and not too believable, but necessary within the time frame of the film. The moments where he cared for Kira as his own daughter seem to momentarily suppress our perspective of his condition, but when he starts to put her in situations that suggest a setup for someone to potentially abduct her, we know he is still unstable and it keeps us guessing as to just what he is planning since he's spent a good deal of time reviewing his daughter's kidnapping over and over again, attempting to orchestrate what could have gone differently.<br /><br />An offbeat flick that showcases Lewis' remarkable talent; watch with the expectation of absorbing a character study - not sheer entertainment.
