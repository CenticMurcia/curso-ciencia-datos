I'm taking about the cover of the Troma DVD box. There is like NOTHING accurate about that except that the woman on it looks like the actress. Other than that, nothing. There's a body hanging from a tree, there are chickens pecking at a body, there is an Italian looking guy buried and about to get a sickle through his head. And, oh, let's not forget the biggest thing... this movie does not take place on a farm! There is no silo, no wheat field, no big red barn, no big tractor, no livestock. It takes place in a backwoods liquor still. Back-WOODS. Not a place for a farm.<br /><br />But you have to expect the cover art to cheat you, it's a common trait among low-budget flicks to trick you with a flashy poster or cover art and what you get is a less-than-flashy movie. The story is really about a few bank-robbers/jewel-thieves taking shelter at a house occupied by a hypocritical backwoods moonshiner and his much younger wife. The "farmer" gets wise to the fugitive nature of his guests and they find out that he's got a stash of money somewhere. Problems and murder arise.<br /><br />Terror this is not. Neither demented. However, it does keep your attention. Most of the characters are not likable. The body count does get steep for such a small cast. There is also a moral to this story as told by Carradine that focuses on the evil nature of greed.<br /><br />Not a slasher movie, not an action-thriller, not even much of a melodrama. I wouldn't really recommend this to anyone because it has nothing going for it. Unless you want to see another "I-could-do-better-than-that" movie. Although watching obscure genre movies may be entertaining from time to time.
