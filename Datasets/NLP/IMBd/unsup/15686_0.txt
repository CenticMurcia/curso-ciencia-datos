This show was great, maybe someone can't appreciate it because they're used to nonstop crap being pummeled at them through their countries shows. I found this site searching for the seasons to buy, for my 3 kids. This show made kids use their minds and imaginations as opposed to most of the cartoon or mind numbing shows that are on now. And it was from Canada - but how can it compare with jewels like KFed and Brit from your great country, I guess. Loved this show when I was a kid, I know lots of other people did too. I wish I could find some toys and memorabilia to buy, all of the shows that were on when I was little were so much better than the majority of stuff now.
