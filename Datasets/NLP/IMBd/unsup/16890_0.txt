Watching how Metallica created and recorded the Black Album with Bob Rock was an inspiration. I never thought much of these guys before, but I now have a much better appreciation of their work since seeing this video.<br /><br />Certainly Metallica fans would benefit by watching this video. You get a good sense of what drives them. Although perhaps not the most articulate individuals, they come across as genuinely concerned with how they communicate with and stay true to their fan base.<br /><br />Musicians will find this video particularly valuable. You get a behind-the-scenes look at the creative process. Despite, their initial reluctance at working with a big-name producer, Bob Rock brings his bag of production tricks to the project and eventually earns the band's respect. <br /><br />Overall, this is a good video for rock music fans to watch, even if you don't like heavy metal.
