This movie's plot was so simple and easy, that it's a wonder how the filmmakers could mess it up. I understand that these people didn't have the biggest budget in the world, but they had everything they needed to make (at best) a mediocre movie, and failed MISERABLY.<br /><br />The first half of the movie explains all of the character's motivations...and it works. Asides from some dialog, I enjoyed the first half. I wasn't expecting to relate with any of the characters or even like them, but I did. Some of the characters were really interesting and you could understand why they'd want to leave 'the life' behind. Then comes the 2nd half of the movie.<br /><br />The 2nd half of the movie throws out all of the character development out the window and we just can't wait for these people to die. It's as if the writer of the 1st half let his little nephew still in Junior High School finish the script. Some parts are damn near insulting of one's intelligence towards the end.<br /><br />Even though I hung my head down in shame in some parts that could have been gold, I give the filmmakers respect for some of the visuals in this movie. The filmmakers had all the right tools to make a decent flick, but in the end, it's missing something that is supposed to make a movie watchable...a decent script.<br /><br />3/10
