After his artsy fantasy "The Thief of Baghdad" freaked everyone out, Doug got back to basics with this sequel to his first swashbuckler, "The Mark of Zorro" -- and concocted a meticulously designed, take-no-chances star vehicle. The sets, cast, and screenplay are all impressive but, as always, it's the Fairbanks persona -- an odd combination of pragmatist and dreamer, magician and acrobat, lover and fighter, rogue and moralist -- and his endless bag of tricks, gags, and stunts that sets the film apart from, not only 1920s action spectacles, but those of his successors: Jackie Chan, James Bond, and Indiana Jones.<br /><br />Of his later pictures, perhaps only "The Gaucho" tops this one for sheer excellence in filmmaking.
