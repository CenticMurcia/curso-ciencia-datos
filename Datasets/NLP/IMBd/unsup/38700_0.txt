Jamie Kennedy sucked in the movie! the movie was actually pretty funny but all Kennedy talked about the whole movie was about how much he sucked. in every seen he was either reading a movie review that said he sucked or interviewing someone that said he sucked...his doctor even said he sucked! Jamie Kennedy Sucks! you showed a clip of you making fun of country music and then showed a clip of people falling asleep during your show, and then you get mad when the teenagers say you suck. i cant tell you how much you suck. the movie was cool when he wasn't in it but when he was all he was doing was telling the world he sucks at comedy. How do you get mad at hecklers you interview? you ask people you obviously know are gonna talk trash about your show and when they do you get offended. way to set a double standard. If i ever go to one of your shows its gonna be to throw a tomato at you. whenever someone asks me about this movie i tell them its a bad ass movie but all the parts with Jamie Kenedy suck so fast forward threw it.
