Personally I have never been a fan of the crocodile Dundee series. I find the humor to be childish and the action to be less than sub-par. But my mind sure was changed after viewing this one! I found myself delightfully entertained throughout the entirety of the movie. I was either laughing hysterically or on the edge of my seat at all the crazy mishaps Dundee managed to get himself into. I figured he'd have a difficult time with the culture change, but not do such crazy things like he did! LOL absolutely nuts!! The best part has got to be when they are trying to save the skunk on the express way! OMG I though for sure I was going to faint from laughing so hectically hard. I mean they stopped the entire freeway just for a skunk. Can you imagine if that really happened in LA!?! People would absolutely freak about it! Either way this is a must see film, I hope they come out with another witty installment as good as this!!!
