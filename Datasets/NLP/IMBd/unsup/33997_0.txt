OK, so the movie wasn't exactly the scariest movie ever. Well It wasn't scary at all. But atleast it gives some sort of explanation for the demon that posses Regan. In my opinion this movie is more of a well... documentary or saga about what Regan goes through after the whole ordeal with the demon we now know was Pazuzu. So if you don't try to think of it as a horror story it isn't that bad and atleast it gives you some sort of closure to whatever it is that happened to Regan in the first place. I enjoyed this movie unlike most other viewers and I look forward to seeing what the new exorcist coming out in 2000 will be like.
