I don't know how many times me and my wife have seen this video, I stopped counting at 25. Really sharp dialogue - sometimes it seems quite improvised, and sometimes it seems carefully planned. One of the favourite scenes is when David (Peter Dalle), after one of many quarrels with Marie (Lena Endre), smashes the TV-set he just bought in the street and then gets arrested by the police.
