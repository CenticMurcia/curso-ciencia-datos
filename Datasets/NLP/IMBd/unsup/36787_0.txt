And with that I mean, I sat in a theater watching this movie, and within 10 minutes I was ready to leave, I don't know, I just couldn't relate at all with the story...<br /><br />The real confoundment came to me when leaving the theater (To this date, I have never walked out on a movie for better or worse) and my friends totally loved it. It was like I was watching some other movie altogether...<br /><br />Don't get me wrong with saying that and giving it a 3... I just think that I wasn't intended as part of the audience, because yes, it's beautifully shot. Yes it contain a bunch of exceptional characters, yes, it has some hilarious scenes and all that but the story never connected to me... I don't know, I just honestly don't know. It could be that all of the pal's that was at the theater had a background as struggling garage-bands. I didn't. You might love it...<br /><br />This all got to me as a surprise. I totally loved Malmros's last film, Smala Sussie, which had a wacky plot about movie-lovers/makers, a category of people that I feel included of, and I think I now can say that those that didn't love Smala Sussie probably was in the same seat as I am with this picture... I just don't get it. To me it was a movie about a struggling band with far too much Moodysson (a filmmaker that I never understood the greatness of) thrown in it... It's a shame and pity... I wanted to love it, but in the long run didn't care when the credits rolled...
