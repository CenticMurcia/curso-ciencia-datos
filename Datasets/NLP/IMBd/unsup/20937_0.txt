To start, this is HILARIOUS. Although some of the jokes may be grotesque and stupid, you can't help but crack up. Jim Carrey's rubber-like face is funny on its own, but add great jokes and it's perfect. The acting is mediocre, and the story is...well...basically just put there to carry along the jokes.<br /><br />This is the ultimate highlight of Jim Carrey's career, and his funniest. This is the funniest movie of all-time, with "Planes, Trains and Automobiles" in a close second.<br /><br />9/10
