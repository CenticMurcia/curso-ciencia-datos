Tobe Hooper is well known for his hit cult Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Whereas I did enjoy this film, I didn't think it was as good as people said it was. Everyone stated it was excessively gory and violent, however when I watched it I didn't think it was too bad. When I read reviews of this film...everyone stated how they didn't like it. Over the top violence, poor plot and lack of depth is what the critics said. When my friend brought it over I watched it and found it a pleasant surprise. It opens up with a good, solid, brutal and violent murder. What follows is a series of other deaths of tenants in an block of apartments, and one woman trying to see out what's happening. The murders are very original, and gory but I think could have been better if the director had a bigger budget = making the death scenes even worst and bumping the rating to an 18 (UK). The only thing I have against this film is that the killer isn't properly explained. He's said to have been fighting out of his dead mother and therefore being born as a part of death. This could have been explained a bit more, and the reason why he is disfigured is never explained either. The ending is a bit more to be desired as well. The police arrive, and the body is missing. Next thin you know he' jumping through a window (on the third floor) to attack the victim again, and ends up being hung outside. Again when the police arrive the body is gone..... What would have been better is if he would have won, and killed the victim in the way he tried to (sawing her in half) - but that's just my sick opinion.<br /><br />Overall this film is impressive with good scares, gory deaths and a suspenseful and indulging plot. Much better than I expected and a well deserved 8/10.
