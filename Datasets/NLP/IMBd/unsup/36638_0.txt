This movie was not very funny, and it didn't work either. I'm a Pink Panther fan and like any devoted fan I try to watch every Panther movie, but this was not worth while. It started interestingly though, but Edwards used all his material with Sellers too soon and stretched the movie endlessly. NOTHING at all was funny after the first half. Before the first half were admittedly some funny parts, mostly left over material from "Strikes Again" (I thought the car lighter scene was funny and also the scene on the plane). The film could have worked if it were 60-70 minutes and on TV, but this film runs for more than 90 minutes! And even more so. It ends with the mystery unsolved (Whaaaaa!) This film can EASILY be trimmed of material since it is very loose already but I don't think it would be worth it. Edwards could have made SO much better out of what he had. Only recommended if you would like to see some extra scenes that are a little funny accompanied by their original films<br /><br />3/10
