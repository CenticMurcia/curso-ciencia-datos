I've seen my fair share of B-films, bad acting, non-existent plot, so bad that they are funny. Unfortunately this film doesn't make it into the last category which may have redeemed it slightly. With the exception of Meg Foster, the characters are out acted by the Thunderbird puppets. The script (script? nothing this bad deserves the name of script) is banal, boring, riddled with inconsistencies and loaded with clich√©s. It was either written by someone who has never read SF in their life, or was hacked to pieces by the director so it could be filmed for $10.50.<br /><br />It is not even worth seeing as shlock. I tried to give it away but found no takers. The film was a waste of time and effort to film, and is both a waste of time and an insult to the viewer.<br /><br />It deserves a negative vote, I would even settle for a zero, but have had to give it a one under protest. The only worth in this film was in the DVD case.<br /><br />Avoid like poison ivy. Watch a decent B-film like Attack of the Killer Tomatoes.
