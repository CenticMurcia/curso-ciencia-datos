After being tempted by a cool shot in the trailer on TV (an ant walking away with a finger), I decided to watch this 'monstermovie'. Boy, what total piece of crap this was. I don't know what's worse: the special effects, the poor acting or the absence of a decent script. Look at those CGI-ants, donÂ´t they look frightening real? NO THEY DON'T!!!! They look like black moving dots, nothing more nothing less! Look at the people running away from the black dots, don't you care for them and their safety? NO I DON'T!!!!! They all act as stupid as hell: Shooting bullets at a legion of black dots who're coming at you doesn't have much effect. When you're being attacked by the black dots while standing next to a riverbank and the firetorch doesn't work properly just jump in the water! I've never heard of ant attacks in the water! How hard can it be to safe yourself huh? Oh and one of the most annoying things is that when you watch this movie on a channel that doesn't have as many commercialblocks as the American TV stations (one every 10 minutes)you'll get the fade-to-black and then fade-from-black every 10 minutes, which is just put in there for the commercials breaks. I got the feeling I was watching the Bold & the beautiful! Whenever you see this movie in your programmeguide (it's also know as Marabunta btw) then you've got two options: you either ignore it as hell and live your life further without any memory to this piece of crap nested in your brains, or you can watch it and laugh your socks off due to all the flaws, lousy acting and most importantly: CGI-effects that make the original King-Kong look realistic
