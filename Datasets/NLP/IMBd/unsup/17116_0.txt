OK this isn't as good as The Crow: Wicked Prayer (2005) but better than The Crow (1994) some music tracks of this makes me wonder if I have gotten hold of a movie with the same music guy from Universal Soldier: The Return (1999) but take nothing else away from it These Crow Movies need a higher rating me watching them makes me wonder if this is THE GREATEST FILM FRANCHISE OF ALL TIME. yes you read that right I love these movies the only reason I haven't watched The Crow: City Of Angels (1996) is that I cannot find it no matter where I go this villain is one of those "I want him to die" villains I also had never ever heard of these actors (which they were very good) besides Kirsten Dunst which we all know from Spiderman (this movie is way better) now the plot is The third entry in 'The Crow' series follows Alex Corvis, who was framed for the murder of his girlfriend and is executed. he is then brought back from the dead by a crow when the legend says 'Love is stronger than death'. He returns to discover that a corrupt police force is behind her murder and for him to go after the killers, he must find out the mystery behind everything that happened. 10 years old and still a good movie<br /><br />Rating: 9/10
