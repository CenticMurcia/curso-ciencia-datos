The movie drags on and the two poetry researchers somehow seem to stumble upon new clues and evidence that paint the lives of little known poets much better than I could tell you about myself. All of this is gathered from love letters that were kept by each. You really have to see how they jump to conclusions and somehow come up with these clues pretty much when they snap their fingers. The main guy in this was pretty good in Erin Brokovich, but I think he was a little lost in this. Paltrow was broody, cold, and overall not a very likeable woman. Somehow, within 2 days these two wind up in bed together and commiserate in their sins while the audience thinks about how they wish they hadn't canceled that root canal they had scheduled. Overall, just not a good story to draw from.
