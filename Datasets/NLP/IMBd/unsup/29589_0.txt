After patiently waiting a year and a half for the corrected DVD release of DOTR, I was excited to buy it because I heard a better DVD was coming out. Even when I heard all the deadly reviews, I still wanted to buy it. Everyone was complaining about the fact that Steve Harris (Maiden bassist) had edited it, so I thought they were kidding me. Unfourtunately, I was wrong. The editing sucked. Here's why.<br /><br />*SPOILERS AHEAD* Firstly, the camera shots don't even last between 2 to 3 seconds, except for in between songs. What really annoyed me most was "Dance of Death". When Bruce Dickinson re-enters the stage, the dramatic re-entrance is taken away, so that you can't see him! Now had I have not watched the third disc, I would have thought that Bruce was singing from off-stage. I didn't know who the editor was at first, and I thought he/she should be fired. But when I learned that Steve Harris edited it, I was shocked. He did a good job Maiden England, why can't it be the same for this one.<br /><br />Really I thought it was a good concert, decent set list, I like how they ended with "Run To The Hills", but the editing was just bad. I, Myself, am a Maiden fan, and I will not tolerate such crap. If Steve Harris edits the next DVD, I am not buying it.<br /><br />*SPOILERS END HERE* The DVD package is worth owning, even if you are a Maiden Fan. but If you want a better version, get the CD version. It's for your own good.
