David Dhawan in 1999 after the superhit BIWI NO.1 with Salman repeated Salman and Karisma for the 4th time in his film with this film which released 2 months after the not so successful DHLJ<br /><br />The movie is the same formula Salman, Karisma and Dutt have done for ages Similar to SAAJAN minus there Sanjay was the lead and he had a great role here he is just the typical no nonsense kinda boss who falls in love Even the music is ordinary here and also the romance<br /><br />It's like 9 years after SAAJAN you make a diluted version which looks like a rehash of several other films <br /><br />The film is nothing different and is actually boring to watch Remember DILLAGI, Remember SAAJAN.etc<br /><br />Direction by DD is bad Music is nothing special<br /><br />Amongst actors Salman does his usual stuff he did mostly those days though he was more lively and natural compared to today's comedies of his where he is bad Sanju seems bored Karisma does her part very well Dalip Tahil is okay Shakti Kapoor, Himani are routine Sushma Seth is good
