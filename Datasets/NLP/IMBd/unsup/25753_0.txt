This is a documentary which pays homage to the pure mayhem and fury of the myth/man Bruce Lee! Moreover, it contains the most astonishing scenes from the Game of Death. It shows the scenes how Bruce intended them, and I must say it is awesome to say the least! Whereas the original Game of Death movie almost even manages to ruin the Bruce Lee material (not to speak of the rest of the movie, which is worthless) this new material is mindblowing and real! For example, you can see the Korean Haikido masters lips move in the original Game of Death but there is no speech! Here you hear what he says, and you hear Bruce Lee's comments and thoughts. Such as: "Give him the fatigue bombing!" and wonderful dialogue such as Karim: "You must have given up the hope of living" "On the contrary, I don't let the thought of death bother me", and "I hope you don't mind that we move our man so the two of us have more time to groove!" Moreover, they call each other "baby" all the time. It is truly awesome. The rest of the biography is also good but what makes this a real classic is the remake of Game of Death.
