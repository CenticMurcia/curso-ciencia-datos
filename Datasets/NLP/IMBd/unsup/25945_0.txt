perhaps it's a function of age and geography, but if this is what the younger generation of Americans is like, i am glad i lived at a better time. <br /><br />mcelwee attempts to emulate errol morris but has a long way to go. mcelwee, with his narcissistic focus on himself, something morris always avoids, manages to record (as opposed to filming, because the recording mostly concerns his puerile musings on his own love-life) a lot of drivel. and at 2 1/2 hours you can imagine the size of the pile!!! <br /><br />there was definitely some salvageable material in the film if viewed as a portrait of the south,but i don't know how the movie could have been organized or edited to save it.
