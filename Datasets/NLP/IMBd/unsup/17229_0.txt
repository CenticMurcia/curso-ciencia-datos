There is something when it comes to film and German, during their film history they have give us several of the best films ever made, but the latest decay film in German has only been about Tom Tykwer. Perheaps Hans Weingartner is the man to change that, his earlier film Die Fetten Jahre sind vorbei was a great comedy/drama. In this film he is using basically the same theory, but it is much better done. It is not about young people protesting against society, it is about a man that wakes up and discover that everything he stands for is "shit", and then gathering some folks to start a revolution against the entertainment industry and television companies. The film entertains until the end.
