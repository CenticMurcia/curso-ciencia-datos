I may be way off base on this, but when the McAllisters' car pulls into that Miami Seafood Restaurant parking lot in the pouring rain, there appears to be one single vehicle there. It's a AMC Gremlin, one of the compact models from the 70's. I'll bet this was there as a tribute to Chris Columbus's first movie he directed, "Gremlins." Any comments? I was hoping for something new after the first Home Alone, which all my friends begged me to go see, and my reaction to it was "Uhhh, "The 3 Stooges" were funnier and I can watch them for free on TV." (I thought it would have been more realistic and still funny if the bandits were actually menacing.)<br /><br />Altho I fully respect Macauley Culkin, this movie bored me to tears.
