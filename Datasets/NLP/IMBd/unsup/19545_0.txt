I honestly loved this movie. I think it's better than the first. The songs are great. Especially, 'You Are The Music In Me.' Pure genius! Troy and Gabriella are great. It was sad when they had their break up. I cried! But I'm glad they got back together and I really hated Sharpay in that one! >:( I can't wait until the third one comes out. It should be even more awesome. Hmmm, i really don't know what to say about it except how great it was, so I'm gonna stop typing. But first i'm going to type some words: Excellent, Awesome, Spectacular, Fabulous, Fantastic, the great shimmy-nits! I have more but now i'm really done. Good-bye HSM2 Fans.
