First of all, let us examine the title. If a humanoid is "like a human" then is an aquanoid "like.....water?" Hmmm....<br /><br />Anyway, this movie is so bad it will give you a headache. Not even kidding, the aspect ratio of the film is bad, so the screen contorts not only the video, but also your retina. And the acid-flashback you go on every time they show the aforementioned water-like creature doesn't help either. While it provides minor nudity, and some violence (like a man who stands helpless as his balls are crushed to a bloody pulp by a girl, a feeling you will share at the end of the movie) we only recommend this in cases of extreme desperation.
