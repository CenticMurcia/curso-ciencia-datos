The daredevils/heroes are: Gene-- the brains of the outfit, Tiny  a gifted strongman, and Bert -- an agile escape artist. They are aided by Carole Landis who plays Blanche Grandville  the granddaughter of Horace Grandville whose multimillion dollar industrial complex is under attack by master criminal 39013. This film is twelve chapters of action packed cliff-hanging fun. <br /><br />I particularly liked the fact that these circa 1939 daredevils did almost all of their action scenes in double breasted three piece suits! <br /><br />The history of the major actors is quite interesting: <br /><br />Dave Sharpe,Bert, became an Army pilot during WWII and a major stuntman; having a long and celebrated career in the industry. He has been ranked with the great Yakima Canutt. <br /><br />Charles Quigley, Gene, had a good career but died of cirrhosis of the liver before he turned sixty. <br /><br />Bruce Bennet aka Herman Brix, who played Tiny, was a 1928 Olympic champion who went on to a very long career and lived to be over 100 years old. <br /><br />Carole Landis was 29 when she committed suicide. <br /><br />I bought this film because of the multitude of glowing reviews found on this forum. I was not disappointed!
