The characterization and acting were generally acceptable in this movie but the script let them down. There were many instances where the dialog made no sense, in other cases it was just unintentionally humorous.<br /><br />Examples; when Jennifer arrives and everyone is in the drawing room and Eva makes her entrance. She completely misses the existence of the only stranger in the room; Jennifer. Then, upon seeing this stranger standing there, she fails to realize that this is her cousin - who was expected ("should have picked you up at the station"). How could she not instantly know who this was? <br /><br />Later Jennifer asks Eva what the doctor said about Ted, she replies, "Did you see how the doctor trembled as he spoke to me? You'd think he'd never seen a beautiful woman before!" For the life of me I can't figure out who she was referring to; it couldn't have been herself.<br /><br />While Crawford is not mud-ugly she certainly is not beautiful  by '55 standards or by today's. With her long square face, too-intense eyes, and caterpillar eyebrows she is far from beautiful (handsome, perhaps). And while the above line alone wouldn't have been sufficient to criticize, similar references to her "beauty" appeared often enough to insure this wasn't unintentional.<br /><br />Then you've got to wonder what hold this woman had over these people. She wasn't pretty, charismatic, rich, or sexy - so what was it? To steal a line from "10 Things I Hate About You"; "Wha'does she have, beer-flavored nipples?" And the characters kept going on about how nice Eva could be when you first meet her  what? At no point in this movie could Eva be considered "nice". This lack of likable side ruined the opportunity to contrast nice with mean leaving a one dimensional character rather than the intended schizoid persona.<br /><br />Lastly, the scene where Eva was informed by Jennifer of Carol's suicide was absolutely hilarious. Totally out of character, overacted and with ridiculous smearing of coal cream on the mirror. What was that about?<br /><br />While I enjoyed the movie it was far from great and only approaching good. 3 out of 10
