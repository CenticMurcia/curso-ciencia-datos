This was indeed an excellent movie, but I remember seeing it on the big screen, I am quite sure it is not a "TV movie" as several others have said here. I am sure many know it only from the TV broadcasts, as its theatrical distribution was probably not widespread. Take a look at the movie poster on this page (have you seen that many movie posters for TV movies??!!), and make your own judgment. Jones is indeed superb, and though the premise is somewhat far-fetched, it is not important, because the drama remains. An important period piece of its time. I remember the performances and the cinematography to have been excellent also. PLEASE get this out on DVD ASAP! Great flick!
