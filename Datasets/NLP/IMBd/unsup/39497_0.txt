It may be no coincidence that the title letters of this movie form the acronym SIC, and while it certainly isn't suitable for the mainstream prime time TV slot, serious students of bondage or porn will be disappointed if not downright bored by the film. That is, unless jabbing a girl in the buttocks with a needle, playing "doctor" or hide-and-seek, really turns you on.<br /><br />The title would lead you to believe it is a heavy S&M number, but there is little in evidence apart from decorative dog collars and light chains as the "victim" is led (otherwise unconstrained) around. The two brothers who kidnap young girls and keep them prisoner are not the sort I'd like working around my local school, but they seem far removed from the likes of The Collector or Buffalo Bill (Silence of the Lambs) - too boofy if anything (tho capable of killing).<br /><br />Any "drama" in SIC seems contrived or stilted. There is sex, a little of it forced, but generally quite tasteful and with little real conviction. Nudity likewise is limited and subdued.<br /><br />Overall, the film falls well short of any potential hinted at in its title. It's neither an entertaining porn flick nor a serious insight into disturbed mental states, nor a horror flick. It gets a 2/10 from me.
