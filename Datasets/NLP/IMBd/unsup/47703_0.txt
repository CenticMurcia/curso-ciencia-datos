I can't imagine, how this film could manage to gather the actresses like Charlotte and Natasha but meanwhile to make up such a meaningless story. Calling itself a thriller, it was just able to produce a minimal atmosphere that a typical thriller movie needs, and the ending is absolutely disappointing. I think, the script writer must have lost his last little bit creativity and logic to write down such a ridiculous bedtime story. Besides, there are too many useless roles and branch plots. Give me the scissor, I will cut it from 90 min to 30 min, without making the movie worse. All in all, this time travel stuff is not an easy cake, the logic behind these kind of movie is questionable. The only way to let the audience forget asking why this why that is a good, captivating plot. But this film has definitively not one.
