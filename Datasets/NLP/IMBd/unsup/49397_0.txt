Porn! I love porn with every fibre of my being. Pornography has undoubtedly been one of the greatest influences in my life. Zombies! Zombies are just cool. Terrifying yet they command your empathy. A slow relentless scourge that forces man to look in the mirror and face his demons. Or because they eat brains. Whatever. So naturally you combine these two extremely cool genres you're bound to have something worth watching, right? Nearly. This film is a mess. Two guys and a girl go to the forbidden Cat Island (oooooo, spooky name) as the superbly mustachioed property developer (who earlier gets nasty with two ho's) wants to erect (pun intended) a hotel there. Of course there is a mysterious girl and old man on the island, and zombies. What are they doing there? Who knows? Who cares? Sex scenes scattered throughout the whole movie. Plenty of nudity for the perverts. I was disappointed there is only one porn scene, would've been great to see Laura Gemser get in on the action!!!!
