Aside from the perfect graphics, music (despite low-quality samples), gameplay, controls and the terrific, gigantic and ingenious level layouts, Super Metroid was also a thrilling video game experience like very few others. I can count in my fingers the number of games in all these years that were truly capable of putting me in the shoes of the protagonist: Super Metroid, Metal Gear Solid, Zelda:OoT, Shadow of Colossus, Metroid Prime 3.<br /><br />Super Metroid did just that: put me in the shoes of a space bounty hunter battling bazillions of aliens while exploring the deepest recesses of creepy alien environments in search of the last Metroid. The real world simply vanishes and you are just there. It didn't even need first-person view to do just that, like in the Metroid Prime series. It is that mindblowing, specially in its heyday: it was like witnessing Star Wars back in the 1970's.
