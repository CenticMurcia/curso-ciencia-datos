These comments apply to the version of this film shown recently on the Logo channel, which may or may not be the complete version.<br /><br />I was not too eager to watch yet another documentary about the Holocaust, but had seen little on film about the Nazi's persecution of homosexuals, so decided to steel myself and give it a chance.<br /><br />This is a beautifully made film, well constructed, and telling a compelling story. As a documentary film maker myself, I know I would have been tempted to try speeding up the pacing. That would have been so wrong, and the filmmakers here managed to avoid that trap. Instead we are given a chance to journey beyond the obvious "sound bites" and start to understand just a little of what those interviewed went through and who they are (while avoiding the maudlin Barbara Walters approach, which can so easily rob the subject of his/her dignity).<br /><br />By careful pacing, skillful choice of materials, and beautiful editing, we are pulled into this little told story of barbarism and bravery. It is extremely moving without feeling in any way exploitive. Bravo!
