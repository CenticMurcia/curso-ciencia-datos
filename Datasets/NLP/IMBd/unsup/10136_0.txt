This film which I just saw is extremely powerful. I, myself am a<br /><br />Catholic so I found this film of special interest since it is about a<br /><br />Jesuit Priest. The priest is a brave but flawed man. The theology<br /><br />of the time was also extremely flawed. Especially the reasons for<br /><br />converting people. But the film is all about the ending. SPOILER<br /><br />ALERT: When the Native Americans tell the priest baptize them<br /><br />because he loves them and not because baptizes them for their<br /><br />conversion or because they believe it is a magical ritual that would<br /><br />cure them. This almost moved me to tears. This is what<br /><br />conversion and baptism should be about.
