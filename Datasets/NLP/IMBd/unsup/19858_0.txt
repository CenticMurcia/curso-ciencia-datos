I used to remember when b-grade movies used to have at least some redeeming quality about them, be it the effort that some actors went through to do what they must to make a buck, or even something about the story that had a certain charm. Phobic isn't one of these.<br /><br />In it, Joey Walters, played by Billy Parish, (who would pass for Brandon Lee were it not for the dumb look on his face) has agoraphobia- fear of socializing and the outside. In this case, every time someone opens the door, he starts to space out and see double. Well, we see double and the camera pulling in and out and the brightness turned up too high- we have no idea what Joey sees. Perhaps it's that crazy lunatic that killed his sister that still haunts him- who calls him on the phone, and eventually enters his house, that's driving him crazy? Perhaps he has schizophrenia instead? And what is it with all these bodies showing up? At one point, we see a single little gleam of light that may not save the movie, but show us a surprise. But no. Who cares.<br /><br />Bad synthesized music, sound levels that are not audible enough, cheap camera tricks that's supposed to pass off for special effects, and of course really bad acting. If you're looking for gore, you won't find any here and what's supposed to be scary isn't. If you're in the mood for a spooky man living in your house, see Hider in the House. If you want to see I'm a crazy person seeing things, see Spider or a Beautiful Mind<br /><br />2 out of 10
