You've seen this movie before I promise you.<br /><br />You have a high school drummer and predictably his Dad doesn't believe in him or his ambition. This kid's unorthodox style doesn't sit well with the college, is torn between his friends or his music and all sorts of stuff like that. Nothing worthy of note happens until the climax and oh boy is it a climax!<br /><br />The final sequence is really really great 5 star entertainment. They should have just made the whole movie about this!<br /><br />First you have each of the colleges perform a montage of music which is all very well but the real show stopper is the final drum line showdown which is just incredible. If you need to demo your home cinema that's a scene worth a look.<br /><br />So yeah. Just skip to that part. Or if your not into that at all you can skip the movie altogether, you can always watch the final scene on Youtube.
