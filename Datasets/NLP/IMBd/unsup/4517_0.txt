I'm not one to get excited about romantic comedies, but I found "Never Again" to be a real gem of a film. The acting in general is superb, and the film manages to be both terribly funny and genuinely poignant at once. Though a few stretches of the story drag slightly, the overall effect of this film is true-to-life charm. I recommend it highly.
