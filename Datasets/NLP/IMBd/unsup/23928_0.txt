This was a great Woody Allen movie. He was not in it, but his voice was. I very young SETH GREEN played the kid who saw a German U BOAT off the Jersey Shore. That was a very strange scene. But this movie, about the days when RADIO was the main thing, not TV - really made me think about what life was like for my Mom and Dad in the 40's. Very good movie and there was so much history in it. I liked that one radio show that focused on having breakfast with this pretentious couple. Today it would not go over well. Now we have legends such as Sean Hannity and Rush Limbaugh talking politics. Back then, it was more of an entertainment median. I loved this movie. Not much of a story plot but just watching it was fun.
