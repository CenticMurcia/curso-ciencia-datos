It was quite a coincidence that today April 3, 2005, I first saw this great piece of comedy "My favorite Year" as so happens to be the birthday of Anne DeSalvo who played Alice Miller.<br /><br />I dedicate this comment to Ms. De Salvo on her birthday.<br /><br />This film is truly one of a kind. non-stop laughter. Peter O'Toole and Joseph Bologna sure were at their best. Not an easy thing to notice since, since I consider both to be among the best actors of our time. not to be out done Bill Macy as Sy Benson, Anne DeSalvo (of course) as his secretary Alice Miller , and Lainie Kazan as the mother of Stone (who was put in charge of the O'Toole character Alan Swann ) . All gave quite stellar performances.<br /><br />The film centered on Benji Stone , excellently played by Mark Lynn-Barker. He tells the story of the year 1954 in which he while working on the set of a comedy. He is charged with keeping the fun loving , hard drinking Swann (O'Toole) out of trouble . By no means an easy task. The things they do together are quite out of the ordinary. Though he is in charge of keeping Swann out of trouble, he really gets to enjoy his job.<br /><br />This film also show the side of the entertainment history we don't see, Swann (O'Toole ) confesses that his entire "persona" is a fabrication of the studios, and show his own insecurities.<br /><br />This film is fine entertainment.
