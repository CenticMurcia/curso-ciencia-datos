Okay where do I start! This hunk of crap only runs 84 minutes, yet I feel I have lost months of my life! It actually took 3 hours to get though because I kept scanning back in disbelief to make sure I actually saw what I saw. Despite the obviously low budget for a thriller, a 4 year old child with a video camera could stage and direct more dynamic action sequences. I mean seriously, how the hell did the DP make Super 16 look like my cousins wedding video...it looked awful. The opening shots of the Russian gunship's flying in for their "raid" looked as if they had been stolen right off an intro for a video game. Is this why the "news chopper/Russian gunship" they blew up later in the "film" with their "high tech visual effects" rocket launcher looked so strikingly similar. I was so embarrassed for the poor "actress" that had to pretend she was shooting that mailing tube at the cartoon circling above. Is there a shortage of straight to video movies or what. Who buys this crap. Speaking of the "talent"... How can these "filmmakers" think they can use nothing but non actors to carry their "movie", it was just offensive. As if three hours wasn't enough time for me to waste, I absolutely had to watch the gripping behind the scenes footage! At one point I heard the director say "Quiet on the set!! WHY!! SO THEY CAN CONCENTRATE!! I almost passed out from laughing so hard...Whoa! we wouldn't want to loose focus while trying to shape and mold this masterpiece. These people had schedules, deadlines the whole nine yards! Like it was a real job or something! One guy in the interviews had the audacity to say what they were accomplishing was truly amazing...looking back, I have to agree!<br /><br />For any of you who think I'm just being mean...rent it and tell me I'm wrong.
