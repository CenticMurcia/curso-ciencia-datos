This movie was not all that great and one that I wouldn't recommend checking out if your a serious vampire flick fan. I thought that sense it had Duane jones staring as the main character that it would have at least a little potential in it but what i saw most of his acting was boring dialogue and not enough enthusiasm in his character. Jones gets stabbed by a man that later committed suicide and left jones a living vampire. Jones then sucks the blood of the man and keeps him in the freezer in fear that if he is caught that he will be found guilty of the man murder. Soon afterward we see visions of an African queen somehow in control of Jones and leads him to kill more and more people. Wee see Jones envisioning being at a church in order to free himself of this curse of being a vampire and his fate is left after that scene. The woman on the other hand is the wife of the man that committed suicide and ends up staying at jones place and finds her husbands body in the freezer and finds out that after she has fallen in love with Jones that there is more to this man than she cares to know about. Jones wants to make her immortal just as he is. This movie is unmemorable, slow and boring it tends to want to sway to fans of such movies as "Blacula" but falls to do so.
