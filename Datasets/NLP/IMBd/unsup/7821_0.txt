Professor Alan Whitmore has been sent to Hungary to collaborate with a professor there on some special project involving an ancient cult, or some such thing. While there he finds the professor has had a nervous breakdown & says strange things. Before he knows it, Whitmore has been "sucked into the vortex" of odd things happening, and there are mysterious disappearances taking place at this strange hotel in which he is staying.<br /><br />Further investigation reveals the ancient cult, known as The Weavers, to have some kind of "spider thing" going on, and that there are cult members everywhere, which is evidenced by the odd tattoos they all have.<br /><br />The "mystery" is well-shrouded throughout the film and not revealed until fairly late in the film, although there's plenty of strange goings-on to keep your interest until then. Budpest makes a great place to make a horror film, with deserted streets that are creepy even in broad daylight. When the mystery is finally revealed there are some stop-motion special effects that seem a tad hokey but that's only a minor complaint.<br /><br />There is a feeling of dread throughout the film that is well maintained, and that's a big plus. Strange this is so obscure, because it's well worth seeing and fits well into the Italian horror niche of the 80's. Worth seeing if you can dig up a copy somewhere. 7 out of 10.
