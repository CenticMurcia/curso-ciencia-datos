This film is kind of interesting in a number of ways. The Second adaptation of Richard Matheson's "I am Legend", it stars Charlton Heston as the title character, a scientist who has built himself a fortress. <br /><br />The portrayal of the monsters is interesting. Matheson wrote them as classic vampires, including in his narrative scientific explanations as to why they would be repelled by crosses and garlic. Vincent Price's version (The last Man on Earth) kept it in that vein. The more recent Wil Smith vehicle made the zombies more of a cross between Orcs and Zombies, with a hint of CGI in them. <br /><br />In Heston's version, the creatures are more like the mutants of "Beneath the Planet of the Apes", taking on the quasi-religious nature of the latter group. Very daring, especially for 1971. Even more daring was the interracial sex scene between Heston and Rosaling Cash. (Would never get past the censors today, but it only merited the film a PG rating!) The violence is also very graphic for the time. There was a period in the early 70's where producers could show blood and breasts, and enjoyed the heck out of it for a few years before the MPAA clamped down. <br /><br />Some parts of the film are definitely dated, like the zombies with Afro Haircuts (which quickly fell out of fashion after this film. Co-incidence? I think not!)
