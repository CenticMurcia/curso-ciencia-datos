I, like most, worried that it would degrade "Bambi"...WELL IT DIDN"T!!! I was impressed with Disney in what it put out in content as well as quality!!! Great Job Disney! I recommend this for all our children & grandchildren, and of course, those of us who are children at heart... This movie contained good lessons in morals, honesty, and integrity. Most of all, it was a lot of fun! The movie is so enjoyable for everyone...I wish I could write about the contents of the DVD, however, this would make it a spoiler. I recommend that you purchase this delightful DVD for hours of replay enjoyment!!!!!!! Share this with your friends and family for wholesome enjoyment and family bonding.... :)
