I really don't get why people dislike this film. It wasn't the high gore/'boo' kind of film with silly teenagers having sex and being sliced to death.<br /><br />It reminded me more of J-horror - the creepy,unsettling scenes that make your hair stand on end.<br /><br />No, the movie is somewhat predictable - but the fun was getting there! There were a lot of really spooky scenes that made my tense, and the sound was fantastic. The acting was uniformly of high standard - except, oddly enough Bruce Campbell who I thought was miscast.<br /><br />The only real complaints I have about the film were the forced levity (didn't work for me) which thankfully was very short, and the ending was way too 'happy'/neatly wrapped up for my tastes. I think it would have been more effective to end on a 'picnic at hanging rock' note where you weren't sure what happened to the girls.<br /><br />But for those who have patience and can appreciate mood over gore, this is a very well done film and deserves to be seen...
