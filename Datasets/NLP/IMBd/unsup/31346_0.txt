I watched a few episodes of this programme and increasingly found that by the end of the episode I wished I'd never bothered.<br /><br />When I first watched it I felt that the characters had promise, which is why I watched a few more episodes. Also there isn't too much on Australian TV on a Tuesday night! I soon realised that nothing was going to improve. The programme just has nothing innovative about it. I think the characters are wasted with very pointless clich√©d story lines that wind up far too quickly and conveniently at the end. I don't think the writers are even trying. How did this programme have 4 series?!<br /><br />Don't bother watching it!
