To appreciate this movie the best you have to have lived in Germany during the 80s and 90s. My favorite scene is when Gunther looks for a bottle of Coke and is overwhelmed by "Coke with sugar, Coke without sugar, Coke with caffeine, Coke without caffeine, Coke with caffeine without sugar ... In Germany you only have one choice - Coke!" This was absolutely true! The reviewer who thought Gunther was saying his car runs on "tubers" is wrong. Gunther is saying "Rueben" which is the German word for Turnips. A car that runs on turnips is funnier than a car that runs on potatoes! "Driving Me Crazy" can be compared to "The Gods Must Be Crazy" (which I also like) in terms of comedy. Don't expect Woody Allen-type humor. Pretend you're back in junior high to enjoy this movie the most.
