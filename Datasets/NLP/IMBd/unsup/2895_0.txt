My husband has a 1967 Chevy SS convertible and a 1968 Chevy Impala, and has built a garage as an appropriate temple to his icons. I have never understood why until I saw this film. Skirting devilishly close to clich√©, this coming-of-age-movie never succumbs. Instead, every time you think you know what's coming, something a bit different shows up. The characters are real, their agony shared, and their interactions cause laughter and tears. The 35 mm film and natural lighting provide an appropriate texture to this real-life, grease-on-you-face experience. Watching this movie was like flipping through a scrapbook of everytown USA and spending a day in your past. Even those of us who did not grow up in a small town have small towns inside us. The music was original (nice guitar work; some really good rock) and the acting brilliant for such young actors. I wanted my husband, father and son to see it immediately.
