This is a touching film because it's centred on a man that you will initially dislike and may continue to dislike. That doesn't matter though because it's about non-conformists being able to fall in love without sacrificing their individuality. That's what sets it apart from your typical romantic slush: this is the most genuine, uplifting film I have seen in ages. It isn't formulaic, and it works: future script-writers take note!
