I would compare this to Talk to Her and Heaven. The protagonist commits a terrible crime but turns out to be a likable guy. The murder is over and done with quickly. <br /><br />After that, I laughed a lot. This is more of a romantic comedy than a drama. The characters are somewhat over the top, especially Keiko's mother. The weird thing is the chaste romance story. The lack of PDAs and kissing in a movie with sex and nudity is disorienting. High contrast between a reserved, traditional Japanese culture and frank subject matter. Not for kids. Beaultifully shot. The director is world famous for good reason.
