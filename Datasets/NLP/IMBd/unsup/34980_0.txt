I'd give it 0/10 stars if I could.<br /><br />I'm all for mindless comedy sometimes. I love Ricky Bobby, BASEketball, etc, but this movie didn't know if it was a comedy or a movie with a plot. (hint:it was neither)<br /><br />If you have a movie with funny writing, you can get away with playing it straight. This movie has poor writing, and straight acting making it one miserable 90 minute experience. <br /><br />I've seen High School productions with better writing and better acting.<br /><br />I should have left this so-called movie 30 minutes in and gone to see "Superbad" in the theater next door.<br /><br />This movie was so bad, it makes me want to try to make a movie and my only "training" is an introduction to Theater course that I took in college. HEY !!! maybe that's how this movie got made in the first place.
