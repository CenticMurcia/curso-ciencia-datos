This movie was one of the best Aussie movies that I have ever seen and I have been looking for a copy of it ever since I was in a teenager but with no success, now I know why. Buddies is a true classic, up there with 'All The Rivers Run' and 'The Man From Snowy River'. I think that it is very sad that we will probably never see it again. This movie was a rip snorter and it is a real shame. My wife has mean looking for it for over 2 years now. She tries again every couple of months (when I mention it). I hope to one day watch it again with my wife and kids as they have not seen it yet, but want to as I have raved about it for years. Buddies is a true classic movie and yes I think it would boost the tourism trade greatly. I think a few more Aussie movies on TV would be welcomed by many.
