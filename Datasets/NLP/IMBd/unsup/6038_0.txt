Face it, we all wish we could be more outspoken, and say what we think...to people at work, to people we pass in the mall, to our friends and relatives. And even *gasp* to celebrities? Kathy says what we're all thinking when we watch A-listers on the red carpet, or see them on talk shows pimping their latest project. "What was she thinking with that dress?" "When was the last time she ate?" "She looks like a puffy, sweaty crack W**re" Kathy speaks the very thoughts that cross our minds about A-list celebrities, foreign countries, and brainless professional cheerleaders. Kathy calls it like she sees it whether it comes to Barbara Walters, Gwyneth Paltrow, or Eminem. And she says it so casually, like it's just off of the top of her head. She doesn't hold back, and that's why I love her. And that's why I love this film. Stand-up at it's best.
