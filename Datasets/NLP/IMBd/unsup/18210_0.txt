Great Movie. Again George C. Scott and Marlin Brando did an excellent job of acting. Great plot. The movie develops as a wonderful mystery which evolves into a Good versus Evil. Brando excels with his portrayal of a greedy oil-rich company executive who is bent on keeping a synthetic oil production substitute a secret. Scott is a police detective trying to solve the murder of a long time friend who is associated with "the formula". The end is one the best performances of both actors. The plot and the relationship gets a little confusing with Marta Kellor's role. I think it is realistic of today's corporate scandals.
