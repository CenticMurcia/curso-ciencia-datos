Let it be said a comedy can't run on a one joke premise and that's exactly what Canadian Bacon tries to do. No matter what the media says and portrays stereotypically us Canadians and Americans aren't that different. Sure there's cultural differences, how our countries are run, unique pop culture influences, but we're not miles apart from each other. Canadian Bacon isn't deep, intellectual comedy. It's not brilliant satire either. It's a running loop of overused, unfunny clich√©s.<br /><br />As such, I feel bad for everyone involved. John Candy, Rela Perlman, Michael Moore, Alan Alda, Kevin Pollak. This is absolute junk when you consider this was supposed to be a comedy. It's just plain boring. I only laughed once. It's dry - so very dry. If you're Canadian, feel free to be insulted. If your American, you might find this hilarious. I really don't know. This movie's story revolves initially around a large military arms manufacturing plant closing resulting in the loss of thousands of jobs. Which sounds suspiciously close to the closure of the car plant in Michigan which so happens was covered by Michael Moore and made into a movie too.<br /><br />Welcome Michael Moore. Welcome to the land of hope and freedom. The freedom to sell your wares wherever possible, but what am I saying? You've already been given a lesson in that I see. This is one movie you don't need to see.
