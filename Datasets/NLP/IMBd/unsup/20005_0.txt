This film was quite mediocre, which is okay, because I didn't expect much from it and so could not be disappointed. I have certainly seen worse movies, but I've certainly seen movies a lot better too.<br /><br />Problems with this film include: 1) Incredibly fake-looking gorillas. They looked about as real as the gorilla in Murders in the Rue Morgue, and in that film, the gorilla was supposed to be a guy in a suit. 2) Lame acting. I've seen worse, but I've seen a lot better too. 3) Jane March. Please go put on some weight, and make sure some of it goes into your head. You have the dreaded face pull. Women of the early 20th century may have worn corsets, but they were not that thin. 4) Too much magic. As another reviewer pointed out, if the witch doctor guy can make soldiers and turn himself into a giant snake that's immune to bullets, why on earth does he need Tarzan's help? 5) Fake gorillas. 6) Lame computerized special effects. Come on, I know people who can make graphics that good, and they could never get hired at a place like ILM. 7) Fake gorillas. 8) Tarzan making that stupid yell all the time. We know you're Tarzan; please just run around in your loin cloth and shut up. 9) Fake gorillas. 10) Tarzan's changing accent. Is he British? Is he American? It reminded me of Kevin Costner in Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves. 11) Fake gorillas.<br /><br />I don't know how the book goes, so I won't complain about the storyline or characters too much, though I have to say those bad guys were incredibly lame and paperthin.<br /><br />In relation to the ads for the film, you can tell how big a star is when they have to refer to him as "Casper Van Dien from Starship Troopers". I can say I actually knew who he was anyway, because he was on One Life to Live and Beverly Hills 90210, although perhaps I should not admit that I ever watched those shows.<br /><br />Good things about this movie? Well, the credits are really easy to read, and are clear even on a 14 inch television screen. They scroll nice and slow too. The scenery was also nice, and the single real chimp they used in the film was a better actor than many of the humans were. Casper Van Dien also had a nice body, which is always a bonus; it unfortunately does not make a movie good.<br /><br />In short, this was a predictably bad movie, okay to watch if you're having problems sleeping like I was, but don't waste your money.
