Thanks for your review of Nothing Sacred I appreciate it. But it's a misnomer to compare it to Bringing Up baby. Hepburn and Grant are eccentrics who are living in there own worlds but they screwily belong in each others too, love; and the film shows it's a worlds of eccentrics. The satire is not in those characters, they are not cynical people. Flagg and her sponsor in Nothing Scared are opportunists and they are living in our world of structure that is phony. Mention of racism is odd. The giant black man who 'leans' on hotel doors to collection flowers is doing exactly what the film is about, finding a way to justify/ignore his cynical actions, for his own reward...a very funny moment. Nothing Sacred is a wicked film,in detail...
