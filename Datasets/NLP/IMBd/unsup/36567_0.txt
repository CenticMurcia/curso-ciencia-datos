I have never thought the term "addict" was appropriate for those who are unable to control their sexual behavior, but that is the least of my reasons for disliking this narcissistic semi-documentary. The director has actors portraying characters from the earlier part of his life, and interacting with him as he "plays" himself. And of course he also plays with himself a lot; we are subjected to many scenes where he seeks privacy in a bathroom so he can masturbate. When he isn't engaging in self-abuse he is seeking the company of prostitutes or discussing his inability to stay away from ladies of the night with actresses representing his various girlfriends. Oh, what a tedious exercise; certainly for the audience and one would imagine for the director. But maybe there is nothing about himself that bores this man. Perhaps we can look forward to a film about his smelly feet and how often he washes his socks.
