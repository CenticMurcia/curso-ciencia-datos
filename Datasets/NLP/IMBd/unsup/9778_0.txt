Beyond Silence is a beautiful film that you never forget. Her beautiful scenes and her story make an excellent movie. Her director,Caroline Link,make a sence film about life and love.Her music is wonderfull,including the Klezmer music with the actress,Sylvie Testud,touched in a scene.The rest of actors have a perfect performance.Presented in Mar del Plata Film Festival in 1997,the movie is one of the best pictures of this decade in Argentina. My opinion:The best german film of every times.Please,donÂ´t forget see.Is an order.
