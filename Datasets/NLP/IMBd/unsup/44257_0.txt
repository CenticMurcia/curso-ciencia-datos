this is the movie that killed the ninja turtle francise. The turtle costumes and splinter looked horrible as compared to the other films and the jokes are old and tired, for example - "Im a turtle and i can't get up". Thats so overused its annoying. The one bright point was Casey Jones returning, but he only makes a cameo in the film and is totally wasted. A sad end to the ninja turtle series.
