Today's audiences are a bit spoiled and jaded. This was a great movie for it's time. (Yes, I still have a copy of it on beta format) It is also kind of prophetic since the advancements in computer animation. At some point, real actors will no longer be needed. Hmmmmmm. There is also a "looker" gun that sends out a light pulse that causes the victim to "freeze" and loose chunks of time. (Sounds a little familiar -- anyone seen MIB?) There is the look into the plastic surgery and the need to look perfect (that's where the title comes in). Albert Finney and Susan Dey make an unlikely pairing in this "futuristic" sci-fi drama. Anyway, this is worth checking out. So grab a Tab soda, relax, and try to find a copy of this movie.
