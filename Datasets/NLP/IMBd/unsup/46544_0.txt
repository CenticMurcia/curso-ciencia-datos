Though movie is set to the period of late 19th century but there are many goofs. 1) Handpump shown in the movie is of India Mark II (http://www.skipumps.com/deepwell.htm) which came into existence around 1980.<br /><br />2) Tiled swimming pool and hose pipe were also not available during that time.<br /><br />3) Costume of Nawab is of pathani touch no where near to Lucknowi.<br /><br />4) During mutiny time almost everyone was fleeing from Lucknow to Faizabad or any other city, but movie shows only Aishwarya and her friends going in cart.
