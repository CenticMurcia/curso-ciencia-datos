Logistic regression is very similar to linear regression but has a categorical outcome instead. So rather than modeling a continuous dependent variable, it models a binary classification - yes or no, true or false, 1 or 0. This is still a linear model as it assumes a linear relationship between the independent variables and the link function.  

To learn more about Logistic Regression, try to following resources:
